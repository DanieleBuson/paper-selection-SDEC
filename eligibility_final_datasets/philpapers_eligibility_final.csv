However, followers’ responses to an ethical climate may also differ according to the amount of attention they devote to moral questions. This study analyzes whether moral attentiveness augments the positive effect of an ethical climate on employees’ ethical behaviors, as well as the indirect effect of ethical leadership on employee ethical behavior through an ethical climate. Data from 270 employees in the Malaysian manufacturing industry indicate that the positive impact of an ethical climate on ethical behavior is greater among employees who exhibit high rather than low moral attentiveness; this moderating role also applies to the relationship between ethical leadership and employee ethical behavior through the ethical climate. This study thus sheds new light on the notable role of moral attentiveness in ensuring that ethical leadership and ethical climate enhance ethical behavior in the workplace.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:11,2023-11-06 14:05:11,604–627,Publisher: Routledge,BMNWBTMZ,0.3537414965986394,0.6923076923076923,0.3870530185378128

The process involves the creators or designing professionals, the procedures to develop an ethical agent and the artificial systems. There are two possibilities available to create artificial ethical agents: (a) programming ethical guidance in the artificial Intelligence (AI)-equipped machines and/or (b) allowing AI-equipped machines to learn ethical decision-making by observing humans. However, it is difficult to fulfil these possibilities due to the subjective nature of ethical decision-making. The challenge related to the developers is that they themselves lack training in ethical skills. The creators who develop an artificial ethical agent should be able to foresee the ethical issues and have knowledge about ethical decision-making to improve the ethical use of AI-equipped machines. The suggestion is that the focus should be on training professionals involved in the process of developing these artificial systems in ethics rather than developing artificial ethical agents and thereby attributing ethical agency to it.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:27,2023-11-06 14:10:27,33–47,Publisher: SAGE Publications,VYCPMM9S,0.2546583850931677,0.5,0.2648118809803592

In part, this results from disagreements about the goal of this education, which inhibit the development of and progress in cohesive research agendas and practices. In this regard, engineering ethics faces challenges like other professional ethics. To address these issues, this paper argues that the ultimate goal of engineering ethics education should be more long-term ethical behaviors, but that engineering ethics must more fully engage with the fields of empirical moral and cultural psychology to do so. It begins by considering reasons for adopting ethical behaviors as the ultimate goal of ethics education, and moves on to discuss why ethical behaviors have not been adopted as the goal of ethics education.

In the context of this trend, the ethical considerations of advertising when applying AI should be the core question for marketers. This paper discusses six dominant algorithmic purchase decision pathways that align with ethical philosophies for online customers when buying a product/goods. The six ethical positions include: ethical egoism, deontology (i.e., rule-based), relativist, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and ethics of care (i.e., stakeholders’ perspective). Furthermore, this paper launches an “intelligent advertising” AI theme by examining its present and future as well as identifying the key phases of intelligent advertising.

I show that the subject of inquiry of computational ethics is of great value and indeed is an important frontier in developing ethical artificial intelligence systems (AIS). I also show that computational is a distinct, often neglected field in the ethics of AI. In contrast to much of the literature, I argue that the appellation ‘machine ethics’ does not sufficiently capture the entire project of embedding ethics into AI/S, and hence the need for computational ethics.

The development and organisational deployment of AI is accelerating, but the ways in which this will support or diminish opportunities for meaningful work and the ethical implications of these changes remain under-explored. This conceptual paper is positioned at the intersection of the meaningful work and ethical AI literatures and offers a detailed assessment of the ways in which the deployment of AI can enhance or diminish employees’ experiences of meaningful work. We first outline the nature of meaningful work and draw on philosophical and business ethics accounts to establish its ethical importance. We then explore the impacts of three paths of AI deployment (replacing some tasks, ‘tending the machine’, and amplifying human skills) across five dimensions constituting a holistic account of meaningful work, and finally assess the ethical implications. In doing so we help to contextualise the meaningful work literature for the era of AI, extend the ethical AI literature into the workplace, and conclude with a range of practical implications and future research directions.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:26,2023-11-06 14:10:26,1–16,,S8BX8J2H,0.1206030150753768,0.4,0.1357163039396269

Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a significant role in achieving DT. As DT is touching each sphere of humanity, AI led DT is raising many fundamental questions. These questions raise concerns for the systems deployed, how they should behave, what risks they carry, the monitoring and evaluation control we have in hand, etc. These issues call for the need to integrate ethics in AI led DT. The purpose of this study is to develop an “AI led ethical digital transformation framework”.                                         Design/methodology/approach               Based on the literature survey, various existing business ethics decision-making models were synthesised. The authors mapped essential characteristics such as intensity and the individual, organisational and opportunity factors of ethics models with the proposed AI led ethical DT. The DT framework is evaluated using a thematic analysis of 23 expert interviews with relevant AI ethics personas from industry and society. The qualitative data of the interviews and opinion data has been analysed using MAXQDA software.                                         Findings               The authors have explored how AI can drive the ethical DT framework and have identified the core constituents of developing an AI led ethical DT framework.

While we agree that achieving the ethical devel- opment of digital simulacra requires epistemic respon- sibility, we propose the inclusion of the Ubuntu perspective as an addendum to strengthen the
argument for epistemic responsibility in this context. Ubuntu, a pan-African philosophy, could specify how to conceptualize epistemic responsibility by highlight- ing the importance of forward-looking collective responsibility. In the rest of this commentary, we will argue that this is an ethically fruitful orientation in the context of digital twins.

Examples of this type might include issues of uniqueness, deep societal transformation and inequality, changes to personal character and even the role AI might have in God's ultimate economy of creation and grace.

The analysis predominantly focuses on challenges that arise in terms of representation, embodiment, control by the patients after which the twin is modelled. Many challenges are posited on the existence of digital twins as autonomous technologies capable of acting on behalf of the patient. One may be reasonably sceptical about the potential to achieve ‘digital twins’ in the near future; the author, to his credit, acknowledges this fact in the section ‘Simulating a precise efficacy’ while still providing a faithful overview of a nascent field of development. Given the state of development described in the paper, the risk of autonomous digital twins in the near future seems remote.There are two clear ethical risks of digital twin which, to my reading, deserve more attention than they receive in Braun’s analysis.

The Researching Interventions to Promote Ethics in social care project responded to the question: Which is the most effective ethics education intervention for care‐givers in residential social care? A pragmatic cluster trial explored the impact of three ethics education interventions for: (a) interactive face‐to‐face ethics teaching; (b) reflective ethics discussion groups; and (c) an immersive simulation experience. There was also a control arm (d). 144 trial participants were recruited from 39 residential care homes for older people in southern England. Change scores compared across intervention arms showed a significant reduction in work‐related moral stress in the teaching arm compared with control group (               p                = .03); there were no significant differences between control and intervention arms in change scores for moral sensitivity, interpersonal reactivity (empathy) or ethical leadership. Qualitative data themes were as follows: ethical care; care challenges; and ethical care inhibitors.

In the contemporary smart care scenario, homes are fitted with an array of sensors for remote monitoring providing data that feed into intelligent systems developed to highlight concerning patterns of behaviour or physiological measurements and to alert healthcare professionals to the need for action. This paper explores some ethical issues that may arise within such smart care systems, focusing on the extent to which ethical issues can be addressed at the system design stage. Artificial intelligence has been widely portrayed as an ethically risky technology, posing challenges for privacy and human autonomy and with the potential to introduce and exacerbate bias and inequality. While broad principles for ethical artificial intelligence have become established, the mechanisms for governing ethical artificial intelligence are still evolving. In healthcare settings the implementation of smart technologies falls within the existing frameworks for ethical review and governance. Feeding into this ethical review there are many practical steps that designers can take to build ethical considerations into the technology. After exploring the pre-emptive steps that can be taken in design and governance to provide for an ethical smart care system, the paper reviews the potential for further ethical challenges to arise within the everyday implementation of smart care systems in the context of dementia, despite the best efforts of all concerned to pre-empt them. The paper concludes with an exploration of the dilemmas that may thus face healthcare professionals involved in implementing this kind of smart care and with a call for further research to explore ethical dimensions of smart care both in terms of general principles and lived experience.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:50,2023-11-06 14:09:50,1035–1046,,4KEIILMR,0.1184668989547038,0.25,0.12436138334193

Hence, the view that the clinical benefit of AI systems needs to be studied in clinical trials—particularly randomised controlled trials (RCTs)—is gaining ground. However, an issue that has been overlooked so far in the debate is that, compared with drug RCTs, AI RCTs require methodological adjustments, which entail ethical challenges.

While the use of AI for such tasks can offer many benefits, evidence suggests that without careful and deliberate implementation its use also has the potential to generate significant harms. This raises several ethical concerns regarding the appropriateness of AI deployment to domains such as HRM, which directly deal with managing sometimes sensitive aspects of individuals’ employment lifecycles. However, research at the intersection of HRM and technology continues to largely center on examining what AI can be used for, rather than focusing on the salient factors relevant to its ethical use and examining how to effectively engage human workers in its use. Conversely, the ethical AI literature offers excellent guiding principles for AI implementation broadly, but there remains much scope to explore how these principles can be enacted in specific contexts-of-use. By drawing on ethical AI and task-technology fit literature, this paper constructs a decision-making framework to support the ethical deployment of AI for HRM and guide determinations of the optimal mix of human and machine involvement for different HRM tasks.

The goal and main contribution of this article is to explain how this approach can provide ethical guidelines to the AI industry and to highlight the limits of self-regulation. In what follows, I discuss three institutionalist claims. First, principles of AI ethics should be validated through legitimate democratic processes. Second, compliance with these principles should be secured in a stable way. Third, their implementation in practice should be as efficient as possible. If we accept these claims, there are good reasons to conclude that, in many cases, governments implementing hard regulation are in principle (if not yet in practice) the best instruments to secure an ethical development of AI systems.

There is little literature on attempts to navigate ethical dilemmas experienced during early clinical experiences and whether current curricula prepare students for these dilemmas. This study explores the different ethical dilemmas experienced by medical students on their third-year clerkships and analyzes the factors, sources, and resolutions proposed by them.From 2016 to 2018, third-year medical students completed a written assignment to describe, analyze, and reflect on a clinical situation in which they experienced an ethical dilemma. They identified specific ethical dilemmas present, potential preventative and aftermath solutions, and reflected on their professional development from their experience. The research team utilized applied thematic analysis to identify themes and patterns in the data. A thematic matrix was utilized to examine similarities and differences across medical students.Of the 162 reflections, 144 (88.9%) students indicated an ethical dilemma that included issues related to autonomy and beneficence. Of these, 116 (71.6%) students found the two ethical principles in direct conflict. Students identified three common sources of this conflict: lack of communication; unclear understanding of clinical policies regarding family authority and psychiatric capacity; and medical negligence. Lastly, students suggested different solutions for dealing with and preventing this conflict.Our findings suggest that an overwhelming number of students face ethical challenges when confronted with medical situations that raise conflicts between autonomy and beneficence. Their recommended solutions reveal an appeal among students to have tools and strategies in place to ease the need to make difficult decisions. Medical students might be better served by learning about the complexities of ethical decision-making and the likelihood of experiencing moral distress when they feel an inability to implement what they envision as the best solution.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:28,2023-11-06 14:10:28,227–236,,Z4MY9GVJ,0.1095890410958904,0.2,0.11410145855918

If teaching consists in no more than programming, training, indoctrinating… and if ethics is merely following a code of conduct, then yes, we can teach ethics to algorithmic machines. But if ethics is not merely about following a code of conduct or about imitating the behavior of others, then an approach based on computing outcomes, and on the reduction of ethics to the compilation and application of a set of rules, either a priori or learned, misses the point. Our intention is not to solve the technical problem of machine ethics, but to learn something about human ethics, and its rationality, by reflecting on the ethics that can and should be implemented in machines. Any machine ethics implementation will have to face a number of fundamental or conceptual problems, which in the end refer to philosophical questions, such as: what is a human being (or more generally, what is a worthy being); what is human intentional acting; and how are intentional actions and their consequences morally evaluated. We are convinced that a proper understanding of ethical issues in AI can teach us something valuable about ourselves, and what it means to lead a free and responsible ethical life, that is, being good people beyond merely “following a moral code”.

Understanding care providers’ experiences during health emergencies is key to develop comprehensive ethical guidelines for emergency and disaster circumstances.Objectives: To identify and synthetize available empirical data on ethical challenges experienced by health care workers (HCWs) providing direct patient care in health emergencies and disaster scenarios that occurred prior to COVID-19, considering there might be a significant body of evidence yet to be reported on the current pandemic.Methods: A rapid review of qualitative studies and thematic synthesis was conducted. Medline and Embase were searched from inception to December 2020 using “public health emergency” and “ethical challenges” related keywords. Empirical studies examining ethical challenges experienced by frontline HCWs during health emergencies or disasters were included. We considered that ethical challenges were present when participants and/or authors were uncertain regarding how one should behave, or when different values or ethical principles are compromised when making decisions.Outcome: After deduplication 10,160 titles/abstracts and 224 full texts were screened. Twenty-two articles were included, which were conducted in 15 countries and explored eight health emergency or disaster events. Overall, a total of 452 HCWs participants were included.

We argue that there is nothing inherent in sexual content that makes a study high risk and that many sexual dysfunction studies involve no more than minimal risk. Second, we ask whether research interventions that involve seeing participants undressed or having physical contact with a research subject are permissible?

It then analyses the ethical and social implications of the concept in light of the four principles of medical ethics by Beauchamp and Childress. The term ‘disease interception’ refers to a form of secondary prevention applied in a short interception window intended to prevent a preclinical disease from developing further. We propose the definition ‘early and targeted secondary prevention by treatment’. The ethical evaluation of the concept shows that while it promises to be beneficial, it raises a number of ethical and social challenges regarding patient autonomy and justice. In order to ensure decision-making that respects patient autonomy, commercially motivated metaphors such as ‘disease interception’ should make way for precise definitions.

McCoy et al. introduces the novel Ethical Data Practices Framework and its six core principles to serve as a useful tool to inform both industry and lawmakers of key ethical principles for prospective policies (McCoy et al. 2023). Over the last few years, particularly with the rapid development and deploy- ment of artificial intelligence tools, there have been numerous efforts by companies to self-regulate by implementing accountability frameworks and ethical principles and employing them in practice throughout the company (Chui et al. 2022). Contrastingly on the regulatory side, the current lack of comprehensive fed- eral privacy regulation in the United States has already created numerous opportunities for critical violations to personal privacy with few avenues to mitigate these risks. This has been particularly problematic in the digital health space where, since the COVID-19 pan- demic, thousands of mental health applications (MHapps) have been made available for broad con- sumer use. This has underscored the glaring differen- ces in the handling of medical data collected from digital healthcare compared to in-person services and resulted in unethical practices that have infringed upon patient autonomy and privacy (Jillson 2023). Thus, to allow patients to fully benefit from accessible online mental health care without putting their auton- omy and privacy at risk, it is necessary to implement comprehensive federal privacy regulation in the United States that specifically covers digital health to place guardrails on the selling or sharing of sensitive medical data by MHapps and require adequate, truth- ful notice of privacy risks.

Objectives:               The aim of this study was to explore ethical competence among clinical nurses in selected hospitals in Malawi.                                         Methodology:               A cross-sectional survey was conducted in four selected hospitals in Malawi with a sample of 271 clinical nurses. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires, which included a Moral Competence Scale for Home Care Nurses.

Ethical consideration:               The study protocol complied with all ethical requirements and was approved by the College of Medicine Research Ethics Committee under the University of Malawi.                                         Results:               The clinical nurses in Malawi are ethically competent. However, there is a significantly high number (p < 0.05) of nurses 57% (n = 135) with low ethical competence. There was no significant association between respondents’ demographic variables and level of ethical competence (p > 0.05). Three determinants of high ethical competence level (strong will, judgement skills and recognition of discrepancy of intention) were identified through a reduced model after stepwise logistic regression analysis.

Design/methodology/approach               In the past, a number of influential ethical theories in Western philosophy have focused upon choice and autonomy, or pleasure and pain or fairness and justice. These are important ethical concepts, but we consider “flourishing” to be a broader “umbrella concept” under which all of the above ideas can be included, plus additional ethical ideas from cultures in other regions of the world (for example, Buddhist, Muslim, Confucianist cultures and others). Before explaining the applied approach, this study discusses relevant ideas of four example thinkers who emphasize flourishing in their ethics writings: Aristotle, Norbert Wiener, James Moor and Simon Rogerson.                                         Findings               Flourishing Ethics is not a single ethical theory.

in scholarly venues, I have started to think profoundly about the limitations of
research ethics as a domain for intervention beyond academic contexts.
Because ethics is such a charged term, it can provoke an individualized
response aimed at substantiating the ways in which our actions and practices
abide by ethical codes and protocols. In certain instances, ethics is a box to
tick in the research process. At other times, we might find ourselves relying
on research ethics as a kind of moral ignition that absolves us from further
deliberation. However, if “ethical purity” is an end goal of research ethics,
then we are merely cementing “moral institutional self-concepts” that serve
as a continuation of the collective myth about research as an antidote to
conditions of injustice (Sabati, 2018; Simpson, 2017; Smith, 2012).
The need for research communities to confront ethics is all the more urgent
given how Big Tech is shaping ethics in its own image. In the last few years,
the establishment of corporate ethics charters and ethics boards have come to
signal self-regulation as a policy response to calls for industry oversight. Ben
Wagner (2018) explains how this amounts to an “ethics washing”; ethics are
operationalized through public facing initiatives as a means to resist
regulation. We are provided with the sense of an investment in questions and
concerns of ethics, while little or nothing is done to achieve them.
If an ethics framework constrains how we come to understand the
contradictions and challenges in social media research by regulating the
purview of our engagement with ethics, then what is needed is a framework
that invites a range of stakeholders and entry points (Metcalfe & Dencik,
2019) and that links social media to broader critiques of datafication (van
Dijck, 2014). In their introduction to the special issue of Information,
Communication & Society on Data Justice, Lina Dencik, Arne Hintz, Joanna
Redden and Emiliano Treré write how, “we should use data justice as a form of critique, a framework for shifting the entry-point and debate on data-
related developments in a way that foregrounds social justice concerns and
ongoing historical struggles against inequality, oppression and domination”
(Dencik et al., 2019, p. 876). The work of scholars who are situating data
within existing social justice agendas by cultivating a data justice framework
are effectively reorienting ethical concerns about datafication from purely
moral, technocratic or technological purviews, and advocating instead for
collaborations between different movements and groups that bring together
technological, social, economic, cultural and ecological dimensions in
defining both problems and solutions (Dencik et al., 2018).
Data justice emphasizes an understanding of data technologies and data-
driven decision-making in relation to structural conditions that continue to
create new inequalities and injustices (Dencik et al., 2019; Metcalfe &
Dencik, 2019; Redden & Brand, 2018). However, rather than locate injustices
in data systems as errors or biases that can be fixed with more data, data
justice seeks to understand the interests driving the processes of datafication
by decentering data in the examination of these processes (Dencik, 2019;
Metcalfe & Dencik, 2019; Taylor, 2017). Thus, data justice is symptomatic of
the complex ways in which data-driven processes permeate all facets of
contemporary life and emphasizes how these technologies and processes
reproduce, are reproduced by, and provoke a “matrix of domination” (white
supremacy, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, and settler colonialism) (Costanza-
Chock, 2018a, 2018b)",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:09,2023-11-06 14:05:09,450–457,,AJ9ZF6TR,0.0996168582375478,0.625,0.1061321636894833

It suggests that a specific way of conceptualizing human life — namely as a set of tasks to be optimized — is responsible for the much-criticized information hunger of these digital assistants. The data collection of digital assistants raises not just several issues of privacy, but also the potential for improving people’s degree of self-determination, because the optimization model of daily activity is genuinely suited to a certain mode of self-determination, namely the explicit and reflective setting, pursuing, and monitoring of goals. Furthermore, optimization systems’ need for generation and analysis of data overcomes one of the core weaknesses in human capacities for self-determination, namely problems with objective and quantitative self-assessment. It will be argued that critiques according to which digital assistants threaten to reduce their users’ autonomy tend to ignore that the risks to autonomy are derivative to potential gains in autonomy. These critiques are based on an overemphasis of a success conception of autonomy. Counter to this conception, being autonomous does not require a choice environment that exclusively supports a person’s “true” preferences, but the opportunity to engage with external influences, supportive as well as adverse. In conclusion, it will be argued that ethical evaluations of digital assistants should consider potential gains as well as potential risks for autonomy caused by the use of digital assistants.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:12,2023-11-06 14:05:12,1687–1705,Publisher: Springer Verlag,IUSZAPCA,0.0942622950819672,0.3,0.1025639919470808

The framework aims to guide private industry self-regulation and provide inspiration for federal policymaking to facilitate consumers' ability to exercise meaningful control over their data. Though the authors mention Internet applications (apps) and reference health data, it is important to examine how this framework can be applied to specialized health apps, as these applications are developed by private industry to collect sensitive and identifiable health information.
In this commentary, we apply and evaluate the Ethical Data Practices Framework for digital therapeu- tics, which are a specialized kind of Internet health application. Digital therapeutics (DTxs) are health apps and websites that support the self-management, prevention, and treatment of a variety of health condi- tions. In the United States, most DTxs require a pre- scription from a medical professional for users to gain
access. In addition, nearly all DTxs undergo clinical trials for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. They incorporate clinically validated meth- ods such as behavioral therapies into video games, online modules, and smart products (e.g., wearables) to provide supplemental behavioral coaching, self- tracking, and health education to improve symptom management and health outcomes (Patel and Butte 2020). For example, the DTX Nerivio is an FDA- approved and prescription-required acute migraine treatment for adolescents and adults. Patients wear a wireless stimulation unit and use a phone app con- nected to a HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)-compliant server to self-treat, track migraines, and view daily analytics in a person- alized migraine dairy (Ailani et al. 2021).

Mainstream data and computing ethics approaches, which tend to view ethics itself as a technology to produce particular outcomes, fail to adequately consider the context of the datafied world for ethics. The datafied world is a condition in which data and computing technologies form the ineluctable infrastructure for daily life, structuring social order, forming power relations, and supporting visions of desirable futures. I argue that the datafied world is not just a background upon which ethics unfolds, rather it demands a novel framework for ethics that understands the contexts of data and computing technologies and their consequences for human action. The idiom of co-production suggests how action gets tied to visions of the good in the datafied world. In particular, it draws attention to the evolution of these actions in the identities, institutions, representations, and discourses of the social world, creating specific forms of life and meaning in datafied societies.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:50,2023-11-06 14:09:50,,Publisher: SAGE Publications,VGBHKCRI,0.0957446808510638,0.1428571428571428,0.0987807379174146

We conclude that, as a professional collective, AI experts, to some extent, are responsible in a forward-looking sense for consequences of use of AI technology that they could foresee, but with the risk of increased influence of AI experts at the expense of other actors.

This essay reviews two edited volumes that are published at the end of 2022. Ethics in the AI, Technology, and Information Age provides cutting-edge insights about the emerging ethical issues related to the advancement of digital media and technologies, and Social Media Ethics and Covid-19 offers multidisciplinary perspectives about the ethical use of social media (or the lack thereof) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These two books present helpful materials for us to think about current issues and look toward the future.
Boylan, M., & Teays, W. (Eds.). (2022). Ethics in the AI, Technology, and Information Age. Rowman & Littlefield.
This book is edited by two philosophy professors with an expertise in ethics: Michael Boylan from Marymount University, and Wanda Teays from at Mount Saint Mary's University. While the book title is not explicitly tied to media ethics, most information technologies covered in this volume play important roles in media and communication industries. In the preface, the editors explained the purpose of this volume is to ""promote discussion on how we might take the best from technology while avoiding possible ethical pitfalls."" This is a discussion important to media ethics when more and more information and digital technology are being used in media industries.
The 20 chapters in the book are divided into three parts: theoretical background, applications, and challenges. Michael Boylan starts the book with two chapters discussing ethical reasoning and the definition of ""nature."" The ethical reasoning chapter provides a detailed philosophical explanation of different views and principles about moral decision-making. The chapter on ""nature"" discusses this concept as a ""background condition"" that is fundamental to evaluate various technologies when they go against nature. Boylan outlines the ethical constraints on interfering with nature (p.25), and advocates for a ""go slow"" approach to technological changes. Part one of the book further discusses the relationship between humans and machines with such topics as transformative technology, which the authors define to be ""technology significantly transforms existing states of affairs"" (p. 35), transhumanism, which promotes technology to radically enhance human intelligence, health, happi- ness and longevity"" (p.49), and artificial intelligence's impact on human rights.
Part two of the book strikes me as the most relatable among the three for media ethics scholars as the topics are directly connected to technology's impact on media use, media landscape, and moral development. ""The Moral Fog of Social Media"" by Dean Cocking and Jeroen van den Hoven describes how our social worlds online create ""moral fog"" that obscures our understanding of value and reality. They remind us that the ever-developing social worlds, now with the ""metaverse,"" are selling us",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:47,2023-11-06 14:09:47,60–63,Publisher: Routledge,4RV48BUN,0.0867158671586715,0.3333333333333333,0.0924448127224635

How do engineering students engage with the three spheres of engineering ethics during a global pandemic? The COVID-19 pandemic represents a dramatic and ongoing real-world challenge affecting many students personally. This research explores the extent to which engineering students engage with each sphere of engineering ethics by examining how engineering students understand their roles in addressing the pandemic and its implications. We conducted a survey with undergraduate engineering students (n = 410) at a university in the Midwest. Qualitative analysis suggests that there was low engagement with both social ethics and professional ethics among respondents, while there was higher engagement with technical ethics. Quantitative analysis suggests that non-conservative engineering students from less wealthy families in our study show higher engagement with technical ethics as compared to conservative engineering students from less wealthy families. Non-conservative engineering students from wealthy families, however, show similar engagement with technical ethics as compared to conservative engineering students from wealthy families. In addition, engineering students from both wealthy and less wealthy families show higher engagement with technical ethics if they reside in urban areas as compared to engineering students from both wealthy and less wealthy families in non-urban areas. In addition, the difference in terms of engagement with technical ethics between non-urban engineering students from less wealthy families and urban engineering students from less wealthy families is larger than the difference in terms of engagement with technical ethics between non-urban engineering students from wealthy families and urban engineering students from wealthy families.

In this article, we present an auditing framework to guide the ethical assessment of an algorithm. The audit instrument itself is comprised of three elements: a list of possible interests of stakeholders affected by the algorithm, an assessment of metrics that describe key ethically salient features of the algorithm, and a relevancy matrix that connects the assessed metrics to stakeholder interests. The proposed audit instrument yields an ethical evaluation of an algorithm that could be used by regulators and others interested in doing due diligence, while paying careful attention to the complex societal context within which the algorithm is deployed.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:10,2023-11-06 14:05:10,,Publisher: Sage Publications,TFPHDLBC,0.0952380952380952,0.0,0.0910003345600535

The centrality of this element invites reflection on the conceptual relation between explicability and the four bioethical principles. This is important because the application of general ethical frameworks to clinical decision‐making entails conceptual questions: Is explicability a free‐standing principle? Is it already covered by the well‐established four bioethical principles? Or is it an independent value that needs to be recognized as such in medical practice? We discuss these questions in a conceptual‐ethical analysis, which builds upon the findings of an empirical document analysis.

The personalized and dynamic features of the human microbiome suggest the potential of its manipulation for precision psychiatry in ways to improve mental health and avoid disease. However, findings in the field of microbiome also raise philosophical and ethical questions. From a philosophical point of view, they may yet be another attempt at providing a biological cause for phenomena that ultimately cannot be so easily localized. From an ethical point of view, it is relevant that the human gut microbiome comprises data on the individual’s lifestyle, disease history, previous medications, and mental health. Massive datasets of microbiome sequences are collected to facilitate comparative studies to identify specific links between the microbiome and mental health. Although this emerging research domain may show promise for psychiatric patients, it is surrounded by ethical challenges regarding patient privacy, health risks, effects on personal identity, and concerns about responsibility.

Unethical uses of Artificial Intelligence are therefore a Big Data problem, at least to some degree.

However, there is mounting evidence that Ethical Artificial Intelligence principles and technical tools have little impact on the Artificial Intelligence that is created in practice, sometimes in very public ways. The goal of this commentary is to highlight four interconnected areas society can invest in to close this Ethical Artificial Intelligence publication-to-practice gap, maximizing the positive impact Artificial Intelligence and Big Data have on society.

When considering the introduction of AI to support medical decision-making, one must take an end-to-end, holistic approach to development, evaluation, integra- tion and governance.

It dictates the source and representa- tiveness of the data, quality and reproducibility of the training labels, model choice, and the approach to val- idation as steps toward implementation. A lack of
attention to this critical first step will result in not only in a failure of the AI to breach the threshold of useful- ness when deployed in the real world but greatly increases the risk of unintended consequences.

It therefore interrogates the full research landscape, from funding models, to research design (including research topics, partnerships, methods, participant selection, and researcher positionality), to dissemination plans and ethical gatekeeping.

Therefore, it is important to distinguish between autonomous AI weapons and an AI with autonomy, a distinction that creates two different ethical problems for their use. For autonomous weapons, their limited agency combined with machine-learning means their human counterparts are still responsible for their actions while having no ability to control or intercede in the actual decisions made.

Recognition of the need to develop effective vaccines at unprecedented speed has led to calls to accelerate research pathways ethically, including by conducting challenge studies (also known as controlled human infection studies (CHIs)) with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus which causes COVID-19). Such research is controversial, with concerns being raised about the social, legal, ethical and clinical implications of infecting healthy volunteers with SARS-CoV-2 for research purposes. Systematic risk evaluations are critical to inform assessments of the ethics of any proposed SARS-CoV-2 CHIs. Such evaluations will necessarily take place within a rapidly changing and at times contested epidemiological landscape, in which differing criteria for the ethical acceptability of research risks have been proposed. This paper critically reviews two such criteria and evaluates whether the use of effective treatment should be a necessary condition for the ethical acceptability of SARS-CoV-2 CHIs, and whether the choice of study sites should be influenced by COVID-19 incidence levels. The paper concludes that ethical evaluations of proposed SARS-CoV-2 CHIs should be informed by rigorous, consultative and holistic approaches to systematic risk assessment.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:10,2023-11-06 14:05:10,79–79,,RX2UTXWC,0.075268817204301,0.2857142857142857,0.0840944406125289

Consequently, AI health apps seem to gain a paternalistic potential. This is a game‐changer, for corresponding issues of paternalism can then no longer be traced back to human engineers.

Using social media platforms and online data collection when conducting research brings many advantages, such as being able to communicate remotely but directly with gatekeepers and collaborators, and in reaching potential participants on a global scale. However, neither the guidelines and advice for conducting ethically sound internet-based research, nor the academic literature focussed on building equitable research partnerships between the Global North and the Global South, offer much information regarding the ethical concerns, or address the grey areas, posed by this type of digital and distanced transnational research. In our experience, conducting research remotely made negotiations of access very challenging due to the politics of positionality between Global North and South researchers, lack of clarity on ethical processes and (mis)perceptions of gatekeepers who we could not meet in person.

The spread of digital technology to all parts of our lives has led to meaningful benefits, ranging from the conveniences offered by ride-sharing apps to predic- tion of mental health crises and tracking of COVID- 19 infections. However, these advancements have come at a cost, allowing ubiquitous and largely unregulated collection of digital data by companies. For people to avoid collection of such data has become nearly impossible, which has reshaped con- ceptions of personal privacy and raised concerns of erosion of societal trust and weakening of democracy (Magi 2011).
Data collected from internet browsing, social media, smart phone applications, home alarm systems, wearable devices, electronic health records, and con- sumer credit histories, to name a few, can all be merged, analyzed, and used to target marketing efforts for various products and services. They can also be used to identify and track individuals, reveal and pre- dict sensitive information reflecting personal health, and target and prosecute people. The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health, for instance, which eliminated federal protections for abortion rights and triggered state laws banning or restricting abortion, actualized concerns that data col- lected by companies could be shared with and used by law enforcement to track and find people seeking reproductive health services. Attempts at constructing guardrails and regulating the collection of digital data in the United States have been limited.
In their target article, McCoy and colleagues advance an important, comprehensive ethical frame- work to conceptualize and translate specific values to bolster digital privacy and data protection regulation (McCoy et al. 2023). In the Ethical Data Practices framework, the authors extend beyond the Fair Information Practice Principles, which originated with the work of Alan Westin more than a half century ago and was further developed in subsequent
government reports (Federal Trade Commission 2000). McCoy and colleagues outline six foundational principles pertaining to the collection and use of per- sonal data: minimizing harm, fairly distributing bene- fits and burdens, respecting autonomy, transparency, accountability, and inclusion. They then describe how these values can be translated into practical impera- tives for companies that process personal data, both voluntarily through self-regulation and as a govern- ment regulatory requirement.
In this commentary, I discuss how we can build on McCoy and colleagues' framework to move toward greater digital privacy and protection of personal data. First, I elaborate on the principles underlying the Ethical Data Practices framework, highlighting factors that are important to consider for regulatory design. Then, I address the challenge of translating the prac- tical imperatives from the framework into actionable steps toward companies' self-regulation and govern- ment action.
Notably, the authors' framework moves beyond the traditional notice-and-consent model, which is widely considered inadequate for protecting digital privacy (McGraw and Mandl 2021). As the authors write, ""notice-and-consent regimes thus produce asymmet- rical power relations wherein companies enjoy enor- mous discretion to collect and use data in ways with far-reaching social consequences while affected people lack meaningful opportunities to assert their interests"" (McCoy et al. 2023). The list of substantive and pro- cedural principles serves as a set of normative con- cepts. The procedural principles, in particular, provide a foundational roadmap for decision-making within organizations and across regulatory regimes.
A common theme across the three procedural prin- ciples-transparency, accountability, and inclusion-is the centering of the interests and preferences of indi- viduals and communities that are affected by compa- nies' practices.

This paper provides the first investigation to determine if intuitionism has any validity within business ethics.

It considers art documents where unreality and mistruth are part of a document’s creative and artistic purpose. Three examples of exhibition documentation for contemporary art are explored. These illuminate the KO implications of unreal elements in artworks, exhibitions and documents, and the interplay between them. Three models are then presented relating to the KO of unreality. Model one shows how the wishes of the creator are a significant part of ethical KO for art and the ethical KO decisions which result from the performative and experiential aspects of art documentation. Model two illustrates how the placement of the unreality in relation to metadata creation can have a critical impact on ethical decisions in KO. Model three posits unreal-ness as a novel type of information about metadata creation, introducing categories such as motive for the deception. It shows how this original way of contemplating applied ethics in KO is vital for all ethically challenging works. Ultimately, considering the KO ethics of art documentation extends our thinking about how to deal with deception and unreality and adds an important aesthetic-ethical dimension to the corpus of work on KO ethics.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:13,2023-11-06 14:05:13,631–645,Publisher: Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH & Co.

The acknowledgement of equal dignity implied by people-centric artificial intelligence (AI) is utterly unthinkable without this possibility of equal participation.

Objective:               The purpose of this article is to gain deeper insight into how nurses as leaders in somatic hospitals describe ethical challenges.                                         Design and method:               We conducted individual, quality interview with 10 nurse leaders, nine females and one male nurse aged 34–64 years. We used a hermeneutical approach to analyse the data.                                         Ethical considerations:               The participants received oral and written information about the study.

Development policies, governance, and economic factors impose new ways of understanding and managing coexistence. Phenomena such as pandemics, global warming, migratory phenomena, the expansion of urban and rural areas, and the development of large-scale monocultures show us that human agency, resources, the environment, and surroundings are increasingly intertwined, both physically and metaphysically, in an increasingly encompassing organism where the dissociation between the local and the global becomes difficult to achieve. With a wide range of actions and relationships, environmental psychology and ethics have the task of rethinking the relationship between cultural elements and the biosphere, in order to achieve a balance between sensibility, responsibility, and responsivity. In this article, I aim to illustrate that a biocultural ethical framework emphasizing socio-environmental justice, applied to geoengineering, not only promotes global socio-environmental sustainability but also recognizes the crucial significance of local ecosystems in climate regulation and biodiversity conservation. To do so, I will briefly present some theoretical elements related to the importance of environmental psychology in understanding the connection between individuals and the surrounding environment. Then, I will succinctly present the concept of the ”3Hs” and its implication on biocultural ethics, and subsequently integrate specific elements of biocultural ethics into the analysis of geoengineering ethics to illustrate the need for a perspective that takes this into account. Through this endeavor, I intend to emphasize the vital role of a holistic, multidimensional perspective that guides individual values and community policies towards sustainable practices, ensuring social cohesion and dialogue, respecting the coexistence of life forms, and protecting their habitats.

It raises challenging empirical and ethical questions due to its complexity and widespread effects calling for a broader approach in ethical evaluation. However, existing approaches often fail to include all relevant value perspectives or lack reference to empirical data on the artifact in question. In this paper, we describe the development of an interdisciplinary framework to analyze digital contact tracing from an empirical and ethical perspective. Starting with an analysis of methodological tensions in the attempt to analyze digital contact tracing, we, firstly, set out three methodological premises regarding (a) a specific view of technology, (b) a fruitful normative perspective, and (c) ways to gather empirical knowledge about the object under investigation. Secondly, we inspect consequences of these premises to develop our research methodology. In doing so, we argue for a postphenomenological perspective on technology, solidarity as an important concept to guide the ethical perspective, and an empirical approach based on qualitative social science research and the concept of affordances. We illustrate these considerations by referring to our analysis of the German Corona-Warn-App as an instance of contact tracing based on the Exposure Notification Framework by Google and Apple. We then discuss the implications of using such a framework, including considerations concerning future developments of technologies similar to or inspired by the current concepts of contact tracing.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:27,2023-11-06 14:10:27,1–24,Publisher: Springer Verlag,SL7G8MP5,0.0822510822510822,0.0,0.0772251641816859

Founders of genomic sequencing companies openly discuss their desire to monetize personal gen- omic information (Swisher 2021). This is not to vilify either China or the biomedical industry, but to high- light that key actors in the global pursuit of healthcare AI-powerful nation-states and multinational corpor- ate entities may not reflexively adhere to Athenian ethics as filtered through the British and American centuries.
For example, with an ethical consideration like privacy, in non-healthcare contexts, we've already seen nation-states incorporate personalized data (to an extent many Americans would view as violations of their privacy) into surveillance tools felt necessary for protecting state security (Ng 2020). Similarly, such as with the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook scandal, we've seen corporate entities view what many Americans would view as violations of their privacy, as fundamental to their profit drive.
For another example, the ethical considerations around bias are going to be quite different for an AI tool being trained on an exclusively Han Chinese data set for deployment in an exclusively Han Chinese population than the considerations around an AI tool being designed for deployment in sub-Saharan Africa. While European and American scholarship on biases
may partially inform the sub-Saharan context, regional identities and the legacies of colonialism present chal- lenges of bias in data and AI tools entirely unique to the African context.
What this all suggests is that-uncomfortable as it is to admit-a significant amount of Ethics is regional and political. In the same way that fossil-fuel emitting vehicles have had to be tuned to different emissions standards depending on the commercial market they were being sold in (e.g. Europe versus North America), it is likely that AI tools will have to be ""tuned"" to local or regional ethical mores.
So what are the ethical principles around which AI tools should be ""tuned""? To date there have been many frameworks of guiding ethical principles for AI put forward. Alka Patel and the Department of Defense (DoD) put forward a framework, developed after extensive interviews and rounds of Delphi con- sensus work, encapsulating the main ones: that AI be responsible (that humans are, and need to remain, responsible for an Al's actions and output); equitable (that deliberate steps be taken to reduce and minimize bias); traceable (that AI be constructed with transpar- ent and auditable methodologies, data sources, and design procedures); reliable (that the effectiveness of an Al tool be tested and assured within defined uses across its entire life-cycle); and, governable (that AI tools have the ability to detect and avoid unintended consequences, and the ability to disengage or deacti- vate deployed systems that demonstrate unintended behavior) (Patel 2019).
As an aside the first of these principles, responsibil- ity, may be the most pressing in the near term. The",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:48,2023-11-06 14:09:48,39–41,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,AMKW7LZF,0.0714285714285714,0.2727272727272727,0.0753476611883691

They provide a forum for open communication, where all stakeholders are encouraged to express their concerns and articulate their viewpoints. Ethics consultations can be requested by patients, caregivers or members of a patient’s clinical or supportive team. Although               patients               and by extension their families (especially in cases of decisional incapacity) are the common denominators in most ethics consultations, these constituents are the               least               likely to request them. At many healthcare organisations in the USA, ethics consultations are overwhelmingly requested by physicians and other clinicians. We believe it is vital that healthcare institutions bridge the knowledge gaps and power imbalances over access to ethics consultation services through augmented policies, procedures and infrastructure. With enhanced education and support, patients and families may use ethics consultation to elevate their voices and prioritise their unique characteristics and preferences in the delivery of their healthcare. Empowering patients and families to request ethics consultation can only strengthen the patient/family–clinician relationship, enhance the shared decision-making model of care and ultimately lead to improved patient-centred care.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:28,2023-11-06 14:10:28,240–243,,9P3J33WF,0.0693877551020408,0.1666666666666666,0.0750876913265306

The opacity of black box algorithms is an obstacle to the trustworthiness of their outcomes. Moreover, the use of opaque algorithms is not normatively justified in medical practice. The authors introduce a formalism, called computational reliabilism, which allows generating justified beliefs on the algorithm reliability and trustworthy outcomes of artificial intelligence (AI) systems by means of epistemic warrants, called reliability indicators. However, they remark the need for reliability indicators specific to black box algorithms and that justified knowledge is not sufficient to justify normatively the actions of the physicians using medical AI systems. Therefore, Durán and Jongsma advocate for a more transparent design and implementation of black box algorithms, providing a series of recommendations to mitigate the epistemic and ethical challenges behind their use in medical practice. In this response, I argue that a peculiar form of black box algorithm transparency, called design publicity, may efficiently implement these recommendations. Design publicity encodes epistemic, that is, reliability indicators, and ethical recommendations for black box algorithms by means of four subtypes of transparency. These target the values and goals, their translation into design requirements, the performance and consistency of the algorithm altogether.

Building on existing ethical guidelines for research, we propose a framework for the ethical design and conduct of research involving the imminently dying. To enable rapid translation to practice, we frame the approach in the form of eight ethical questions that researchers and research ethics committees ought to answer prior to conducting any research with this patient population. (1) Does the study hypothesis require the inclusion of imminently dying patients? (2) Are non-therapeutic risks and burdens minimised consistent with sound scientific design? (3) Are the risks of these procedures no more than minimal risk? (4) Are these non-therapeutic risks justified insofar as they are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits of the study?

The pandemic had a serious impact not only on the health sector, but also in the field of social work. During this time, social workers had to address serious ethical questions regarding issues such as confidentiality breaches, how to fairly distribute available resources, the lack of personal contact and emotional connection with the service users, the difficulties of working in isolation and online, doubts about the reliability of the information they were handling and the difficulty of making proper diagnoses. An international research group led by Dr. Sara Banks conducted a broader research project in collaboration with the International Federation of Social Workers, which collected information through an online questionnaire aimed at social workers from various countries. In this article we analyse the results related to the main ethical challenges faced by social workers in Spain. The research group identified two types of ethical challenges that they have separated into two sections: the first section is related to direct intervention with users, which includes topics such as the lack of emotional support, reliability, use of technology, the appropriate care, compliance with the highest professional standards, confidentiality, vulnerability, and the fair distribu-tion of resources.

McCradden et al have exhibited expert scholarship in aligning the evidentiary demands of clinical practice, the ethical demands of biomedical research review, and the technical demands of AI/ML model development in their framework for ethics in clinical translation of AI/ML research (McCradden et al. 2022). In this commentary I step back from eth- ics considerations in the clinical environment to
explore emerging paradigms of research ethics review of AI/ML research across health-related contexts, and conclude with two challenges that I believe point toward crucial developments for the future of the field.
AI/ML research in health-related contexts presents many familiar and some novel issues for research eth- ics review. Familiar issues include the de-identification of health data, secondary use of health data, linking of datasets, the possibility for group-level harm, and data governance more generally. Novel issues include the challenge of promoting data minimization in hypoth- esis-generating research approaches, the opacity of analytic methods, and enhanced calls for building the ideals of social justice and health equity into techno- logically mediated decisions.
These novel issues call for modifications to research ethics review, and many scholars have already offered good suggestions for where and how to make such modifications. Looking across recent contributions to
the literature on this topic, I see four distinct para- digms for research ethics review of AI/ML studies emerging, each with its own merits. In this sense, I use the term ""paradigm"" narrowly to refer to a collec- tion of epistemic and normative assumptions about health, ethics, and AI/ML, and the particular processes implied by those assumptions for learning about and evaluating research at the intersection of these topics. Each paradigm emerges from scholars situated differ- ently in the broader health and social science research enterprise, and each presents unique solutions to the collection of novel challenges posed by AI/ML for health.
The first is the ""values-based data governance"" para- digm, which emphasizes the values that ought to be embedded in governing access to health-related big data for research. An exemplary publication of the val- ues-based data governance paradigm is the work by Xafis et al. (2019), which presents a framework for eth- ical decision-making in the use of health-related big data for research and innovation. The Xafis et al frame- work presents a set of substantive and a set of proced- ural values that are representative of diverse perspectives on big data for health, and outlines a pro- cess for using these values to weigh the impacts of potential benefits and harms of the use of health- related big data analytics (Xafis et al. 2019). The authors highlight a series of potential harms associated with such analyses that demand special attention, including impacts on so-called ""vulnerable groups."" Ultimately, this approach to research ethics review of AI/ML for health is focused entirely on the data being accessed and the potential consequences of doing",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:49,2023-11-06 14:09:49,42–44,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,3KNGCHP3,0.0666666666666666,0.3,0.0719942196531791

Legislation has emerged that seeks to articulate all interests at stake, balancing the need for data flow from EU countries with protecting personal data: the               General Data Protection Regulation               . One of the mechanisms established by this new law to strengthen the individual’s control over their data is the so-called “right to be forgotten”, the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of records. In gender transition, this right represents a powerful form of control over personal data, especially health data that may reveal a gender with which they do not identify and reject. Therefore, it is pertinent to discern whether the right to have personal data deleted—in particular, health data—is ethically acceptable in gender transition. Towards addressing the ethical dimensions of the right to be forgotten in this case, this study presents relevant concepts, briefly outlines history, ethics and law of records considering the evolution from paper to electronic format, the main aspects of identity construction and gender identity, and explores the relationship between privacy, data protection/information control and identity projection.

Often, we can apply previously established principles, even though it may take some time to fully understand the detail of the new technology - or the questions that arise from it. The International Commission on Radiological Protection, for example, was founded in 1928 and has based its advice on balancing the radiation exposure associated with X-rays and CT scans with the diagnostic benefits of the new investigations. They have regularly updated their advice as evidence has accumulated and technologies have changed,1 and have been able to extrapolate from well-established ethical principles.Other new technologies lend themselves less well to off-the-peg ethical solutions. In several articles in this edition the ethical challenges associated with the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in medicine are addressed. Although multiple ethical codes and guidelines have been written on the use and development of AI, Hagendorf noted that many of them reiterated a ‘deontologically oriented, action-restricting ethic based on universal abidance of principles and rules’.
2 Applying pre-existing ethical frameworks to artificial intelligence is problematic for several reasons. In particular, AI has two characteristics which are very different from the current clinical practice on which traditional medical ethics are based:The so called ‘black box’ of deep learning, whereby a deep neural network is trained to iteratively adapt to make better and better interpretations across layers of complex and non-linear data.3 The resulting (and ever adapting) algorithms are generally too complex to interpret or explain, meaning that part of the process that is being used is opaque even to the users.4 This makes it difficult if not impossible to adhere to principles of transparency and informed consent, and restricts the autonomy of the users (both clinicians and patients).Each element of AI has been developed to achieve a particular goal – set by its creators – but has no ‘intent’ beyond achieving that goal. Ethical analyses which include considerations of broader motives or virtuous qualities can therefore not be applied in relation to the AI.These issues are highlighted by S Lee in a student essay.5 Lee examines the NHS code of conduct for artificial intelligence-driven technology, and in particular looks at the conceptualisation of trust within this particular piece of ethical governance. He draws out the challenge of establishing a trust which is ‘rationally justified on sound epistemological bases’ in the context of the ‘black box’ of deep learning. He notes that ‘the Code assumes users are able to and will justify trust by weighing up risk and competence, where risk is the probability of an AI being incompetent at the function it is specified to fulfil, based on performative (ie, quantitative empirical data) information.’
To fulfil this, he suggests, the data used to train the AI would need to be available to all users, in order for them to judge the risk of bias6 and other built-in errors in the algorithms developed. This is clearly impractical. So he suggests that: ‘to foster trust, developers and decision makers should provide information of how they encapsulate the interests of users; they should show their values are aligned with the users.’ In other words we cannot apply the models of trust which are established in the doctor-patient relationship to AI, and so we need to turn to the developers and decision makers: we should assess their intent and competence when designing the system. Lee proposes that a seventh requirement is added to the code relating to the ethical conduct and history of the developers.Turning away from broad ethical codes, Sorell et al
7 examine the tension between traditional data ethics and governance (where the emphasis is on minimisation of personal data collection, processing and sharing) and AI (whose success is dependent on maximal data). They focus their attention on Computational Pathology, where machine learning is applied to digitised whole slide images to improve pattern recognition of cancer presence, progression and prognosis. They draw attention to the mismatch between the motivations behind laws to protect both personal data and pathological samples (where the focus is on not using data or samples beyond direct benefit to the individual without their explicit consent) and the application of these laws to AI.They argue that ‘Stereotypical risks of privacy violation occur where data enables inferences about identifiable people’s current health, wealth, sexual practices, political affiliations and friendships. These inferences may allow individuals or organisations to manipulate data subjects or make an economic gain from information about them’. Where data has been aggregated, ‘it cannot typically be used to identify the data subjects, or disadvantage them…So while deidentification may not amount to out and out anonymisation in the sense of GDPR, it may amount to anonymisation for most practical purposes.’ Here then, the standards applied to standard data sharing – of full transparency and of explicit consent - are almost impossible to achieve and are antithetical to the goal of improved population health. In fact ‘the larger the data sets used for training and validation, the lower false positive and negative rates are likely to be, other things being equal, with corresponding clinical advantages.’ A different data governance framework is needed for the development of Computational Pathology and other AI dependent diagnostic tools, one which recognises the population benefits of data sharing in this context.Finally, Kempt and Nagel8 (and associated commentary authors) discuss the proposal to use artificial intelligent decision support systems (AI-DSS) as providers of second opinions in medical diagnostics, and again the issue of the ‘black box’ comes into play. The authors state: ‘The difference in evidence-processing and lack of explainability renders an AI-DSS largely accurate but unchallengeable. Conflicts between human initial opinions and AI-second opinions, therefore, may not qualify as peer-disagreements, as its ‘reasoning’ is not reason-based like an expert’s evaluation. Hence, we cannot peer-disagree with an AI-DSS, leaving a responsibility gap when trying to decide what to do in case of a conflict.’ They propose a ‘rule of disagreement’ whereby if the AI-DSS confirms the initial opinion no further steps need to be taken, but, where there is disagreement, a second human opinion must be sought; the final arbitrator is the initial clinician.These papers are rich in not only presenting the ethical challenges associated with various elements of AI but in proffering well-reasoned bespoke ethical solutions.Not applicable.Not applicable.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:51,2023-11-06 14:09:51,213–214,,ZXHJMZ5D,0.0701248799231508,0.1818181818181818,0.0714457410069974

McCoy and colleagues (2023) offer a reflective frame- work for data ethics and governance with several his- torical bioethics principles as a foundation. Their framework is one among a plethora of others that attempt to define and suggest responsible data practi- ces, some of which have been published by private companies (Jobin, Ienca, and Vayena 2019). However, while many of these proposed frameworks fall short in outlining mechanisms for implementation, the authors differ by applying substantive and procedural principles through several practical imperatives for data governance. Frameworks that embody this imple- mentation-focused approach help facilitate the transla- tion of ethical principles into practice (Prem 2023). Turning specifically to the imperative of meaningful stakeholder engagement offered by the authors, we suggest patient and community engagement as an opportunity for strengthening local governance efforts and data ethics strategies in healthcare settings.
Comprehensive regulation for the research and development of digital health technologies by private companies, specifically their underlying data ecosys- tems, is severely lacking. McCoy and colleagues high- light a particular need for oversight of private companies in the context of their financial incentives and weak regulation, in contrast to greater oversight that exists for government and academic sectors. Furthermore, in the absence of federal legislation holding private companies accountable for privacy and data protection, self-regulation is rendered increasingly important. While the authors note that self-regulation alone is insufficient, we agree that it is necessitated by the slow and uncertain pace at which we can expect adoption and implementation of federal legislation.
In the current regulatory climate, strategic partner- ships between health systems and large private technol- ogy companies in the pursuit of digital health innovation are increasingly common (Ozalp et al. 2022). These initiatives are characterized by significant investments in technological infrastructure, data acqui- sition, and data analytics to support the development of novel healthcare technologies. However, the nature of these partnerships and the scope of patient data use may not be adequately disclosed to patients (Spector- Bagdady 2020). Given the regulatory complexity and uncertainty concerning partnerships with third parties, the inclusion of patients in data stewardship initiatives can aid in efforts to increase transparency.
While institutions wrestle with identifying and implementing effective governance structures for the oversight of emerging technologies in healthcare, algo- rithms are deployed in the clinic and patient data is collected and shared to drive innovation. Though McCoy and colleagues focus on digital health, Big Data, and privacy more broadly, we posit that the increasing development and clinical deployment of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools lends significance and urgency to calls for oversight due to the unique risks posed to patients. Stakeholder engagement may enhance local AI and data governance approaches by accounting for patient needs and concerns.
In what follows, we describe an academic medical center's attempt to address McCoy and colleagues' call for inclusivity in data ethics through ongoing patient and community engagement. Due in part to the estab- lishment of a 10-year strategic partnership between the academic medical center and a multinational tech- nology company, our institution's board of governors",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:24,2023-11-06 14:10:24,48–50,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,FFTNSQJR,0.0653465346534653,0.3,0.0706361157571487

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic.                                         Methods               A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically.                                         Results               A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for example, Protection of the Public from Harm and Liberty.                                         Conclusions               Allocation of resources in response to acute public health threats is challenging and must be simultaneously guided by many ethical principles and values. Ethical decision-making strategies and the prioritisation of different principles and values needs to be discussed with the public in order to prepare for future public health threats. An evidence-based tool to guide decision-makers in making difficult decisions is required. The equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat is challenging, and many ethical principles may be applied simultaneously.

Unfortunately, developing responsive ethical guidance for how anesthesiologists should best handle ethical concerns with ongoing and mutable drug shortages is limited by the dearth of studies examining how bedside clinicians actually experience drug shortages and what ethical challenges they encounter. In order to better understand what ethical concerns individual anesthesiologists experience around drug shortages and how they negotiate them, we undertook this qualitative interview study. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with anesthesiologists at three field sites: an academic tertiary care adult hospital that performs approximately 46,000 anesthetics annually comprising cases ranging across all surgical disciplines; the affiliated veteran’s affairs hospital that performs 12,000 anesthetics annually; and, the affiliated children’s hospital that performs 20,500 anesthetics annually. Results: 29 anesthesiologists were interviewed (17 adult and 12 pediatric anesthesiologists), representing a spectrum of practice areas in clinical anesthesia: general, pediatric, regional, pain, critical care, obstetrics, liver transplant, and palliative medicine. Three themes emerged: (1) uncertainty about responsibility for clinical decisions made in consequence to a shortage; (2) creativity, and its limits, in choosing anesthetic plans; and, (3) disclosure of concerns about shortages (to patients and colleagues). Conclusions: Our data suggests anesthesiologists have unmet needs for ethical guidance on how to approach drug shortages. First is managing responsibility for decisions stemming from a drug shortage. Second, interviewees struggled with disclosure of their concerns, both to patients and to surgical colleagues. A formal shared decision making approach may present the best solution, since the act of structuring a shared decision making conversation or creating a decision making tool will have to incorporate the views of all stakeholders around shortages and their potential clinical consequences.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:10,2023-11-06 14:05:10,84–91,,VX4CX5L6,0.0610169491525423,0.3,0.069860466489083

As part of efforts to create prorecovery environments, it is important to acknowledge that bioethics debate on SUDs is narrow in scope, prioritising topics related to its traditional interests in individual autonomy and novel technologies. As a result, it has not played a significant role in helping to transform the ethical cultures in which substance use recovery takes place. For example, it largely neglects the ethical challenges of developing an empathic, person-centred approach to substance use problems that listens and responds to the voices of clients.

Prompted by Poland's recent rejection of a European position on AI due to the document's mention of “gender equality,” we argue that Poland followed a strategy that illiberal actors now regularly employ in IOs. To combat gender norms and women's rights across issue areas, illiberal contesters first identify the progressive language in international documents and then threaten to veto those documents—unless such language is watered down or removed. This spoiling strategy, we argue, may not only lead to the compromising of fundamental human rights norms but may also prevent much needed rules for AI from being adopted altogether. Against this background, we urge scholars and practitioners concerned with AI ethics to pay closer attention to illiberal backlash politics.

I was the founding director of CCSR and the creator of the ETHICOMP conference series, which quickly became an important international, interdisciplinary forum to discuss the ethical and social issues surrounding evolving digital technology. The computer ethics community, as it was then known, rapidly grew from 1995 and especially so in Europe, mainly due to ETHICOMP. These conferences were held approximately every 18 months. Nearly 400 papers were presented in the first five conferences held in 1995, 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2001. It became apparent that whilst special issues of extended versions of some of these papers were published in a variety of journals, there was no journal that had the same interdisciplinary perspective as ETHICOMP. It was time to launch a new academic journal, a journal that would capture, for the record, the broader issues surrounding digital technology and how these might be addressed; thus, resulting in acceptable digital technology.

Discussions took place with Troubador Publishing which is an independent UK publisher based in Leicester. It was agreed that a new academic peer-reviewed journal, the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society (originally known as Information, Communication and Ethics in Society [ICES]), would be launched at ETHICOMP 2002 in Lisbon on 13–15 November. I and CCSR Research Fellow N Ben Fairweather were the founding co-editors. A supplement to the first volume was published and given to delegates at ETHICOMP 2002. In the editorial of this launch supplement, we wrote that the computer ethics “…community is multidisciplinary including those from computer science, information systems, law, media, philosophy, politics, psychology, sociology, and software engineering. Partnerships have been forged across disciplines in order to study and address some of the greatest challenges faced by society with the advent of the advancing information and communication technologies. Indeed, we as Editors in Chief are indicative of such partnerships. It is against this backdrop of technological advance and increasing scholarly activity that the Journal of Information, Communication and Ethics in Society (ICES) has been launched. ICES is an interdisciplinary journal which addresses the social and ethical impacts of new media, and information and communication technologies. The editorial board of ICES is drawn from eminent scholars across a wide range of disciplines. The board’s international membership aids ICES in promoting a cross cultural and global perspective. It is a top class refereed journal which appeals to a wide audience.” (Rogerson and Fairweather, 2002, p. S3).

In 2007 after four successful volumes, the journal was acquired by Emerald Publishing. It then became known by the acronym Journal of ICES (JICES). The journal’s original aims remain and are reflected in the current description on the webpage, which states, “It is vital that insight is provided into how we can harness the huge potential of future technological advances whilst avoiding the social and ethical risks.

What happens when a patient-interfacing conversa- tional artificial intelligence system (CAI)-AI that -combines natural language understanding, processing, and machine-learning models to autonomously emu- late human cognition and engagement-says some- thing triggering, is biased or outright discriminatory in its conversation, or makes the wrong association and leads a vulnerable patient away from appropriate conversational therapy and into acceleration of their mental illness? Should healthcare systems allow their AI tools to autonomously evolve, or should they ""lock"" their algorithms, so safety in general and miti- gation of the above issues specifically can be vali- dated? If the former, who is responsible for ongoing validation and monitoring of the AI system to ensure its algorithmic output remains appropriate? If the lat- ter, when and how often should updates happen, given that locked algorithms performance degrades overtime? How should clinicians and healthcare- systems evaluate and mitigate the risks posed by those choices? Are there clinical contexts in which AI should not be allowed to function autonomously and only be assistive?
While, increasingly, machine learning tools are being designed for healthcare contexts (MLHC), these applications are still novel and struggle to ""cross the chasm,"" or demonstrate clinical impact. Given the limited in situ MLHC case studies, potential ethical -concerns with envisioned MLHC still need to be largely extrapolated from ethical problems that have arisen in non-healthcare contexts (Marwaha and Kevlar 2022). Previously, we put forward a framework for identifying ethical challenges with MLHC through considering ethical issues raised by each design deci- sion (and the questions designers needed to answer) along the entire conceptual pipeline from initial envi sioning of an MLHC through deployment and clinica use (Char et al. 2020). We subsequently built on tha framework to consider how to best operationaliz studying ethical issues with regulatory implication (Abramoff, Tobey, and Char 2020). In this commen tary, we emphasize two important design considera tions for CAI with significant ethical implications on patient safety, efficiency, and responsibility-adding to Sedlakova and Trachsel's (2023) discussion; whethe MLHC tools (of which CAI is a subset) should oper ate as a locked or a continuously learning system, and whether they should be deployed as autonomous o assistive tools. As MLHC is early in adoption and clinical testing, the most pressing ethical concern cannot be separated from the 'cross the chasm' prob lem: do MLHC actually work and improve clinica care?",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:25,2023-11-06 14:10:25,43–45,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,XYAAMNWH,0.0615384615384615,0.1290322580645161,0.0660585580098768

In order to establish this claim, I first argue that epistemic technologies can be conceptually and practically distinguished from other technologies in virtue of what they are designed for, what they do and how they do it. I then proceed to show that unlike other kinds of technology (including other epistemic technologies) AI can be uniquely positioned as an epistemic technology in that it is primarily designed, developed and deployed to be used in epistemic contexts such as inquiry, it is specifically designed, developed and deployed to manipulate epistemic content such as data, and it is designed, developed and deployed to do so particularly through epistemic operations such as prediction and analysis. As has been shown in recent work in the philosophy and ethics of AI (Alvarado, AI and Ethics, 2022a), understanding AI as an epistemic technology will also have significant implications for important debates regarding our relationship to AI technologies.

One strategy for anticipating and addressing ethical challenges related to AI/ML for health care is patient and public involvement in the design of those technologies – often referred to as ‘co-design’. Co-design has a diverse intellectual and practical history, however, and has been conceptualized in many different ways. Moreover, AI/ML introduces challenges to co-design that are often underappreciated. Informed by perspectives from critical data studies and critical digital health studies, we review the research literature on involvement in health care, and involvement in design, and examine the extent to which co-design as commonly conceptualized is capable of addressing the range of normative issues raised by AI/ML for health care. We suggest that AI/ML technologies have amplified and modified existing challenges related to patient and public involvement, and created entirely new challenges.

The analysis is conducted at four levels of the engineering education system. First, the individual level is dedicated to findings about teaching practices reported by instructors. Second, the institutional level brings together findings about the implementation and presence of ethics within engineering programmes. Third, the level of policy situates findings about engineering ethics education in the context of accreditation. Finally, there is the level of the culture of engineering education. The multi-level analysis allows us to address some of the limitations of higher education research which tends to focus on individual actors such as instructors or remains focused on the levels of policy and practice without examining the deeper levels of paradigm and purpose guiding them. Our approach links some of the challenges of engineering ethics education with wider debates about its guiding paradigms. The main contribution of the paper is to situate the analysis of the theoretical and empirical findings reported in the literature on engineering ethics education in the context of broader discussions about the purpose of engineering education and the aims of reform programmes.

Methods               We conducted a single-site qualitative analysis of EC documentation for all patients receiving ECMO support from 15 August 2018 to 15 May 2019 (n=68). Detailed analysis of 20 ethically complex cases with protracted ethics involvement identifies four key ethical domains: limits of prognostication, bridge to nowhere, burden of treatment and system-level concerns. There are three subthemes: relevant contextual factors, the role of EC and observed outcomes. Content analysis of transcripts from interviews with 20 members of the multidisciplinary ECMO team yields supplemental data on providers’ perceptions of the impact of the early intervention protocol.                                         Results               Limited outcome data for ECMO, unclear indications for withdrawal, adverse effects of treatment and an obligation to attend to programme metrics present significant ethical challenges in the care of this patient population. Upstream EC mitigates ethical conflict by setting clear expectations about ECMO as a time limited trial, promoting consistent messaging among multiple services and supporting surrogate decision-makers. When ECMO becomes a ‘bridge to nowhere’, EC facilitates decision-making that respects patient values yet successfully sets limits on non-beneficial use of this novel therapy.

By examining a total of 65 works extracted through a systematic database search and backwards snowballing, the authors of this review discuss three categories of opportunities and ten categories of concerns currently associated with self-tracking. The former include empowerment and well-being, contribution to health goals, and solidarity. The latter are social harms, privacy and surveillance, ownership control and commodification of data, autonomy, data-facilitated harm, datafication and interpretability of data, negative impact on relation to self and others, shortcomings of design, negative impact on health perception, and regulation and enforcement of rules. The review concludes with a critical analysis of the existing literature and an overview of a future research agenda that could complement the current work on ethics of self-tracking.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:49,2023-11-06 14:09:49,239–271,Publisher: Routledge (Taylor & Francis),GB5JE57K,0.0544217687074829,0.2,0.0635121741004094

Parker argues that this is wrong.1 Doctors have a pro-tanto duty to switch from a high-carbon metered-dose inhaler (MDI) to a low-carbon dry-powdered inhaler (DPI)—even though this provides no direct patient benefit—unless switching would undermine trust or significantly worsen a patient’s health. He goes on to state that even if DPIs are more expensive for the National Health Service (NHS) then this is justified so long as it does not ‘significantly threaten’ the NHS’ ability to protect and promote health. This may appear to be a radical proposal, challenging the ethical principles of autonomy, health entitlements and justly distributed resources. However, we will claim that it is only radical in so far as one perceives (A) patient autonomy and healthcare entitlements as existing within a vacuum, unrelated to other foundational ethics concerns and (B) the health consequences of a given healthcare budget are limited solely to the designated recipients rather than all affected parties.

In this article, I introduce three modes of reading that can be engaged when studying datasets—a denotative reading (extrapolating the literal meaning of values in a dataset), a connotative reading (tracing the socio-political provenance of data semantics), and a deconstructive reading (seeking what gets Othered through data semantics and structure). I then outline how I have taught students to engage these methods when analyzing three datasets in Data and Society—a course designed to cultivate student competency in politically aware data analysis and interpretation. I show how combined, the reading strategies prompt students to grapple with the double binds of perceiving contemporary problems through systems of representation that are always situated, incomplete, and inflected with diverse politics.

Lack of access both undermines the degree of social benefit achieved by the use of tracing apps, and exacerbates existing social and health inequities because those who lack access are likely to already be disadvantaged. Recently, Singapore has introduced portable tracing wearables (with the same functionality as a contact tracing app) to address the equity gap and promote public health. We argue that governments have an ethical obligation to ensure fair access to the protective benefits of contract tracing during the pandemic and that wearables are an effective way of addressing some important equity issues. The most contentious issues about contact tracing apps have been the potential infringements of privacy and individual liberty, especially where the use of apps or other technology (such as wearables or QR codes) is required for access to certain spaces. Here we argue that wearables, as opposed to apps alone, will make a digital contact tracing mandate more practical and explain some conditions under which such a mandate would be justified. We focus on Singapore as a case study that has recently deployed contact tracing wearables nationally, but also reference debate about wearables in Australia and New Zealand.

Particularly, machine learning (ML) systems cause reason for concern due to their opaque and self-learning characteristics. Nevertheless, what such accountability mechanisms should look like remains either largely unspecified (e.g., ‘stakeholder input’) or ineffective (e.g., ‘ethical guidelines’). In this paper, I argue that the difficulty to formulate and develop effective accountability mechanisms lies partly in the predominant focus on Mill's harm's principle, rooted in the conception of freedom as non-interference. A strong focus on harm overcasts other moral wrongs, such as potentially problematic power dynamics between those who shape the system and those affected by it. I propose that the neo-republican conception of freedom as non-domination provides a suitable framework to inform responsible ML development. Domination, understood by neo-republicans, is a moral wrong as it undermines the potential for human flourishing. In order to mitigate domination, neo-republicans plead for accountability mechanisms that minimize arbitrary relations of power. Neo-republicanism should hence inform responsible ML development as it provides substantive and concrete grounds when accountability mechanisms are effective (i.e. when they are non-dominating).",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:48,2023-11-06 14:09:48,100022,,X68CJ3X9,0.05,0.5,0.0613924050632911

Four hundred sevnty-nine doctors completed the survey. The average self-reported level of preparation in MEL was 63%. When asked to rate how confident they felt in approaching three cases of increasing ethical complexity, more FYs were fully confident in the more complex cases than in the more standard case. There was no apparent relationship with confidence and reported teaching at medical school. The less confident doctors were no more likely to ask for further teaching on the topic than the confident doctors. This suggests that FYs can be vulnerable when facing ethical decisions by being underprepared, not recognising their lack of ability to make a reasoned decision or by being overconfident. Educators need to be aware of this and provide practical MEL training based on trainee experiences and real-world ethics and challenge learners’ views. Given the complexities of many ethical decisions, preparedness should not be seen as the ability to make a difficult decision but rather a recognition that such cases are difficult, that doubt is permissible and the solution may well be beyond the relatively inexperienced doctor. Educators and supervisors should therefore be ensuring that this is clear to their trainees.

In this paper, I argue that examining this ‘scientific analogy’ is crucial to understanding both the limitations and the prospects for ethical bare‐difference reasoning. I expand upon Perrett's discussion of the scientific analogy and examine another relevant similarity. I then highlight two relevant dissimilarities between ethical bare‐difference reasoning and its scientific analogue.

Sweeping artificial intelligence (AI) legislation is on the horizon. To name just a few: In April 2021, the European Union (EU) proposed the AI Act that encompasses all sectors (save the military), and all manner of AI. In June 2022, Canada tabled Bill C-27 which, alongside new proposals for consumer privacy, contains the Artificial Intelligence and Data Act (AIDA). Most recently, the United States established a Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights.
None of the proposed legislation, however, consid- ers the harms to individuals or groups that might result from access to, disclosure of, or manipulation of, mental data. We concur with Palermos (2023) that this is a pressing problem that needs to be addressed.
In this commentary we focus on Canada's AIDA, though our arguments generalize to other regulatory proposals for AI.
Canada's AIDA sets out to regulate ""high-impact"" AI systems, and designates ""high-impact"" based on the harm they could cause. This risk-based approach entails distinct regulatory requirements based on the level of assessed risk. Its stated purpose is ""to prohibit certain conduct in relation to artificial intelligence sys- tems that may result in serious harm to individuals or harm to their interests"" (Artificial Intelligence and Data Act, 4(b)). In Section 5(1), harm is defined as:
a.
Physical or psychological harm to an individual;

But the argument advanced in the article is not merely about the ethics of resistance. It begins, perhaps unconventionally, by addressing the affective dimension of resistance to democratic regressions, looking in particular at the powerful feelings of anger and despair that pro-democratic citizens living under a regressive government are likely to experience.

Serious scholarship in AI ethics sometimes quotes Asimov’s speculative laws of robotics as if they were genuine proposals, and yet Lem remains historically undervalued as a theorist who uses fiction as his vehicle. Here, I argue that Lem’s fiction (in particular his fiction about robots) is overlooked but highly nuanced philosophy of AI, and that we should recognize the lessons he tried to offer us, which focused on the human and social failures rather than technological breakdowns. Stories like “How the World Was Saved” and “Upside Down Evolution” ask serious philosophical questions about AI metaphysics and ethics, and offer insightful answers that deserve more attention. Highlighting some of this work from The Cyberiad and the stories in Mortal Engines in particular, I argue that the time has never been more appropriate to attend to his philosophy in light of the widespread technological and social failures brought about by the quest for artificial intelligence. In service of this argument, I discuss some of the history and philosophical debates around AI in the last decades, as well as contemporary events that illustrate Lem’s strongest claims in critique of the human side of AI.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:12,2023-11-06 14:05:12,92–102,,2SSS7ZUF,0.0568181818181818,0.1,0.0582273786819241

W.; Bredenoord, A. L.; Vermeulen, R.; Jongsma, K. R.",2021.0,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15265161.2021.1991041,journalArticle,"The outline of a framework for assessing privacy risks in multi-omic research and databases provided by Dupras and Bunnik is a valuable contribution to the literature on the ethics of omics data. They provide an empirically informed list of privacy-relevant omic data properties that help us to better understand the variety of privacy risks involved and present three steps that one can follow in order to assess ""data properties and interrelation effects between omic types for the detection of privacy risks in multi-omic research and databases"" (Dupras and Bunnik 2021, 47). In our commentary, we take a step back to dis- cuss their framework in light of the normativity of the concept of privacy. We start by scrutinizing the underlying premise of normative-neutrality in the authors' approach, subsequently show how a normative understanding of privacy would collapse the distinctions that they attempt to make between ""intrinsic"" properties, ""extrinsic"" factors & contextual factors and end by proposing a new and pri- mary step to ethically ground their framework.
Dupras and Bunnik write that their ""model does not make any normative claims about privacy itself, i.e. about the acceptability or unacceptability of privacy risks, or about the proper level of data protection required for the responsible conduct of biological or health research"" (Dupras and Bunnik 2021, 57). However, as privacy itself is a normative concept, the (non) acceptability of privacy risks and an assessment of the proper level of data protec- tion do not exhaust the relevant normative claims. This becomes clear in the authors' cited (overly) broad defin- ition of privacy as ""freedom from unauthorized intrusion,"" (Dupras and Bunnik 2021, 48) because, to have an under- standing of what constitutes an unauthorized intrusion, one is required to make a normative claim about what privacy is (Dupras and Bunnik 2021). To make such a
claim and to mark a particular data property as privacy- relevant, one has to start by making the step from fact to value by explicitly reflecting upon the question what a data property can tell us about what a human being's life looks like. Because the authors do not explicitly problem- atize this argumentative step, they are implicitly working with a normative understanding of what constitutes pri- vate information and thus are attempting to use a norma- tive concept in a neutral way. In practice, this attempt can be seen in their evaluation of various omic data properties in their Table 1 (Dupras and Bunnik 2021).
To illustrate the importance of explicitly reflecting upon the question what omic data can tell us about a per- son's life, we start by analyzing two examples of omic data properties from the authors' Table 1. When considering whether the data property in question conveys observable phenotypic information, the authors do not comment on the data property's impact on the level of data sensitivity. But given that epigenomic information has the potential to improve the accuracy of facial portraits made on the basis of genomic data, we could imagine cases where a person does not want his or her former phenotypic infor- mation to become known because they have had plastic surgery to repair damage caused by an accident (Dupras and Bunnik 2021). Another example from this table con- cerns whether a data property is determined (in part) by acts or behaviors conceived as willful, but here the authors do not comment on the impact that this property has on identifying power. Yet, if the acts or behaviors in question can be linked to a particular type of behavior, then the data property in question has impact on identifying power. For example, one can use high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to determine whether a person uses illicit drugs.

However, I argue, there is more to the concept of justice than what perspectives (considered alone or in their sum total) allow us to view.

With the goal of improving the effectiveness and efficiency of response efforts, humanitarian innovation initiatives seek to develop, test, and scale a variety of novel and adapted practices, products, and systems. The innovation process raises important ethical considerations, such as appropriately engaging crisis-affected populations in defining problems and identifying potential solutions, mitigating risks, ensuring accountability, sharing benefits fairly, and managing expectations. This paper aims to contribute to knowledge and practice regarding humanitarian innovation ethics and presents two components related to a value-sensitive approach to humanitarian innovation. First is a mapping of how ethical concepts are mobilized in values statements that have been produced by a diverse set of organizations involved in humanitarian innovation. Analyzing these documents, we identified six primary values (do-no-harm, autonomy, justice, accountability, sustainability, and inclusivity) around which we grouped 12 secondary values and 10 associated concepts. Second are two proposed activities that teams engaged in humanitarian innovation can employ to foreground values as they develop and refine their project’s design, and to anticipate and plan for challenges in enacting these values across the phases of their project. A deliberate and tangible approach to engaging with values within humanitarian innovation design can help to ground humanitarian innovation in ethical commitments by increasing shared understanding amongst team members, promoting attentiveness to values across the stages of innovation, and fostering capacities to anticipate and respond to ethically challenging situations.

To prevent digital twins from restricting people’s freedom, Braun suggests a strong focus on control.Braun’s focus on control is insufficient, I will argue, because his idea of control works only retroactively: it can only react to restrictions of freedom that have already occurred, but it cannot prevent them, nor can it restore any lost freedom. Control is therefore insufficient to defend people’s freedom. To prove my claim, I will first use an everyday example to illustrate the fundamental ambivalence inherent in digital twins. Second, I will show that digital twins endanger people’s freedom in a hermeneutic way. Finally, I will demonstrate why controllability cannot prevent this hermeneutic endangerment.I understand digital twins, like Braun, as simulation of a person, as their dynamic and precise effigy. Simulated twins use machine-learning and artificial intelligence capabilities to make predictive analyses about the simulated person and the future development of her health.Imagine: You are eating dinner.

217,217,Ethics of Generative Ai,Journal of Medical Ethics,49.0,2,10.1136/jme-2023-108909,"Zohny, Hazem; McMillan, John; King, Mike",2023.0,https://jme.bmj.com/lookup/doi/10.1136/jme-2023-108909,journalArticle,"Artificial intelligence (AI) and its introduction into clinical pathways presents an array of ethical issues that are being discussed in the JME.1–7 The development of AI technologies that can produce text that will pass plagiarism detectors8 and are capable of appearing to be written by a human author9 present new issues for medical ethics.One set of worries concerns authorship and whether it will now be possible to know that an author or student in fact produced submitted work. That seems likely to be a general worry for secondary and higher education, as well as for all academic journals. Thus far generative AI chatbots do not seem to be able to produce a fully referenced and well-argued ethics article, but they probably could generate a blog or student essay that would be hard to detect after very minor edits. Many schools and universities have moved to online forms of assessment, and it seems likely that generative AI might cast doubt on the integrity of them and we might see a reversion to handwritten examinations as a solution.As well as these immediate and perhaps obvious ethical concerns, generative AI highlights conceptual challenges that pose more profound ethical questions. JME is committed to publishing high-quality articles that further the ethical analysis of an issue within healthcare. Some of the content that the journal publishes reports empirical findings. An article that, for example, describes qualitative findings and then develops an analysis of some normative issues could not be solely authored by generative AI: it cannot do qualitative research. However, generative AI can find publicly available sources and produce ethical arguments and syllogisms. What does that imply about the nature of ethical analysis? If ethical analysis, fundamentally, involves assembling, organising and evaluating words, then perhaps generative AI could replace ethicists. At present, generative AI cannot produce the nuance, depth or originality of a quality ethics article, but it may be a matter of time before they pass a medical ethics version of the Turing test.While those who rely on more analytic approaches to ethics might view this as an ethical apocalypse, there are more subtler ways in which generative AI might be used in authorship that are more positive.For instance, if you experiment with ChatGPT9 for a while, you might find that when you know what you want to say in a paragraph or subsection, you can prompt it to form the argument you want to make and it will generate a fairly well-drafted paragraph. For authors and for postgraduate students, this might be useful for ‘throat clearing’ sections which are just laying the terrain for the reader before proceeding.AI chatbots might also play a helpful devil’s advocate: once you make a point in a paragraph, you can ask it to generate a rebuttal. If you experiment with ChatGPT you might find that it can be helpful in that not only does it generate obvious counters, but it often raises things that you might not have immediately thought of. So perhaps generative AI has the potential to pose questions like those that might be raised at a seminar while a paper or book is being refined.Much of the work involved in writing good, innovative and original ethical analysis involves wrestling with high level ideas. If generative AI can aid authors in drafting articles then perhaps they save intellectual effort that could be directed toward the ‘big picture’?Many publishers, including the BMJ, are committed to encouraging authors from the Global South to write for journals where the authorship has been primarily from the Global North. Publishing in journals such as the JME can be more difficult when English is not an author’s first language. Because of the speed at which generative AI can present an author’s ideas in what is close to idiomatic English, they have the potential to significantly open up authorship, especially for humanities style journals like the JME. Journal and copy editors might also save time and effort when correcting articles.These potential benefits will no doubt come with trade-offs. For instance, those who struggle to articulate a point in writing may find that to be part of a process that leads to a new insight. Perhaps generative AI runs the risk of making that part of the writing process too easy and lead to missing out on opportunities for insight. While that seems like a valid worry, it might be that this is analogous to the changes in writing that resulted from journals being readily available online. Those of us who are old enough to recall writing before online publishing will have spent time trudging between library stacks and searching hard copies of journals to find a paper and stumbling across other papers and journals, which may have led to new ideas. Complete reliance on online databases has probably reduced those moments but the trade-off clearly still favours their use.Universities, publishers and journals are likely to be exercised about what this will mean for authorship. How can we know whether work was created by the author or by generative AI? While understandable, these worries might be overstated given what they can do at present. While they might find some publicly available sources to support claims, at present they cannot adequately cite, and the quality of the content they produce is wholly dependent on you asking the right questions or having the right ideas. At present, they can be seen as a very sophisticated thesaurus and we do not worry about authors using those.Perhaps the biggest concern is that some predatory journals may feed off the speed by which low-quality manuscripts can now be generated with AI chatbots, and use the phenomenon to publish huge numbers of mostly useless or misleading ethical analyses. This could flood the journal market and undermine trust in research publications. This may be curbed by introducing the use of AI output detectors, though it may also encourage greater (and much needed) scepticism towards publications, with readers and news writers paying greater attention to where the paper they are reporting on was published, and what the publisher’s standards are.Editorially, journals need to and will continue to be concerned with authorship, but our main focus is on the quality and originality of ideas. It seems likely that generative AI is here to stay and will develop, so journals will need to find ways of figuring out how to work with them.Not applicable.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:24,2023-11-06 14:10:24,79–80,,T2J52ECN,0.0537229029217719,0.75,0.0561779655053683

There is, however, less evidence of the practice of CSR and business ethics in non-Western, transition economies, as insufficient attention is paid to the contextual specifications and underlying processes that may lead to different versions of CSR. Therefore, this paper examines the practice and sense-making of CSR and business ethics from the perspective of the fertile and under researched post-communist context of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), to join the growing academic debate about the impact of cultural and historical traditions on the practice and sense-making of CSR and business ethics in non-Western contexts. The study adopts a particular focus on the post-communist and under researched context of Bulgaria where CSR is still a relatively new phenomenon. By following an exploratory research design and by collecting qualitative data from 34 executives employed by public and private sector organisations in Bulgaria, the study finds that the local business environment is composed of a complex mix of various institutionalised pressures and challenges that predispose organisations to adopt a particular approach to CSR, ethical misconduct and CSR-washing. Apart from the significant contributions related to the practice, understanding and contextualisation of CSR in non-Western countries, the study also identifies challenges of business ethics in transition economies and adds depth to the emerging literature on CSR-washing by proposing a model for neo-communist CSR-washing.

From healthcare decision-making to social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with ethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical characteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons. This behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI agents more human-centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that helps AI agents identify               when               to break rules set by their designers. To understand               when               AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under which humans break rules for pro-social reasons.

The ethics of data management in healthcare is an issue on which we have published a number of papers over the past decade. It seems like only yesterday we commissioned a themed issue of The New Bioethics on personalized medicine, much of it concerned with data ownership and sharing (e.g. Montgomery Citation2017, Lawler and Maughan Citation2017), but in fact that was five years ago. Much has happened since then and almost a half of this issue’s content is devoted to various aspects of data management in bioethics.

In his review article, Althobaiti considers a broad sweep of the roles of big data in personalized healthcare and the ethical challenges associated with its use. He covers public health surveillance, its implications, and the challenges of ‘next generation’ technologies, including robotics and 3D printing and he gives his recommendations on how patients privacy can be protected in personalized healthcare in future. Karabekmez focuses particularly on data ethics and genomics. He examines the complexities of anonymization of data and enhancing security whilst at the same time allowing individuals access to their own data and sharing data access with third parties. As he neatly puts it, ‘ … each new technology comes with its own backdoor, with digital piracy developing at the same pace'. After consideration of data use in synthetic biology, biomedical devices and genetic surveillance, he concludes by looking at some related ethical dilemmas arising from the use of AI in association with ‘big data'. He highlights that ‘AI is just a tool like a stethoscope.’ It enables us to do things we could not do without the tool but accountability for decisions made on the basis of its use, remains with the physician.

The other papers in this issue explore important advances at both ends of life. As the abortion debate in the US becomes increasingly strident at the time of writing, yet remaining essentially a ‘dialogue of the deaf,’ Tunc’s paper on fetal surgery is timely. She explores the way in which the specialty has been politicized in that debate in the US. However her primary aim is to ‘open a new space for active debate concerning fetal surgery in terms of how it medicalizes pregnancy, pathologizes diversity, contributes to the valuation of life, and emphasizes “perfect babies” at any cost.’

Rosenzweig and her colleagues in their paper, demonstrate how human tissue is such a vital resource in cancer research. They outline their development of an autopsy tissue donation programme at the Hillman Cancer Centre, University of Pittsburg, capitalizing on oncology nursing’s multidisciplinary knowledge base and scope in its planning and implementation. They explain the importance of tissue procurement autopsies for their research into breast cancer and consider the ethical dilemmas involved, including obtaining consent in such sensitive circumstances for patients and clinical staff alike. An accompanying, fictitious case study helpfully brings the human element to the fore.

Yet, the risks from increasing bacterial antimicrobial resistance are not restricted to human populations: transmission of antimicrobial resistant bacteria occurs between humans, farms, the environment and other reservoirs. Policies that take a ‘One Health’ approach deal with this cross-reservoir spread, but are often more restrictive concerning human actions than policies that focus on a single reservoir. As such, the burden of justification lies with these more restrictive policies. We argue that an ethical justification for preferring One Health policies over less restrictive alternatives relies on empirical evidence as well as theory. The ethical justification for these policies is based on two arguments: (i) comparatively greater effectiveness, and (ii) comparatively better tracking of moral responsibility.

Ethical practices are therefore even more important for nurses and nurse leaders during this special period.                                         Research aim:               The aim was to explore the relationship between ethical nurse leaders and nurses’ task mastery and ostracism, and to examine the mediating role of relational identification in this relationship during pandemics.                                         Research design:               Based on social exchange theory, this study tests a theoretical model proposing that ethical nurse leaders can increase nurses’ task mastery and reduce their ostracism by improving their relational identification with leaders during pandemics.                                         Participants and research context:               A multilevel and multi-wave field study using data from 172 nurses from 45 departments of two comprehensive hospitals was performed from April to August 2020 to test proposed hypotheses.                                         Ethical considerations:               We received formal approvals from the ethical committee of the hospital where we conducted this study before the data collection.                                         Results:               Ethical nurse leaders can indeed increase nurses’ task mastery and reduce their ostracism during the pandemic period; furthermore, nurses’ identification with their leaders mediates these relationships. We find that ethical leadership plays an even more important role in improving nurses’ task mastery and reducing their ostracism that may be facilitated by pandemics this special time. Nurses will become more identified with their leaders when they are treated by ethical ways.

It is less clear in what way AI can or should support complex clinical decisions that crucially depend on patient preferences. In this paper, we focus on the ethical questions arising from the design, development and deployment of AI systems to support decision-making around cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the determination of a patient’s Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate status (also known as code status). The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act quickly in stressful situations without knowing what their patient would have wanted. We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that (1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and (2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support.

We also find a difference between the interpretation of scriptures (especially Digambara and Svetambara) regarding meditation, and it also sometimes gets translated into the practice of meditation. In the case of Jaina tradition, it is challenging to separate ethics from the spiritual path of liberation and meditation as a practice. In this paper, based on Tattvartha Sutra , Uttaradhyayana , and Acaranga Sutra, I have tried to show that ethics in its restricted sense can be seen as only one aspect of meditation, but in its broader sense, the whole spiritual path suggested in the Jaina scriptures can be seen as meditation. The fourteen stages suggested in the Jaina scriptures can be considered the stages of ethical path or meditation. We can see preksha dhyana - a recent form of meditation that translates these stages into more acceptable to the laymen - a popular and simple form of the spiritual path in modern times.

A common thread running through these articles is what LLMS might mean for scholarship in bioethics, and the impact of this implication (and what the implication might imply for philosophical bioethics) is an issue worth examining specifically.
Cohen (2023) focuses primarily upon the use of ChatGPT in clinical medicine. The ways in which health care is delivered will change in the light of AI input, and this change is perhaps one of the crucial issues that bioethics should focus on. When explain- ing the way in which LLMs work, Cohen notes that ChatGPT is autoregressive (meaning that it uses infor- mation from the past). He remarks,
ChatGPT is trained on the internet and reflects it back at us the phrase sometimes ascribed to Anaïs Nin is apt, we see the world not as it is, but as we are. ChatGPT is biased in all the ways the Internet is.
He's right to point out the impact that LLMs could have in repeating and reinforcing falsehoods and misin- formation. However, this also raises a worry about what this might mean for conceptual analysis in bioethics. There's a sense in which whenever philosophical bioeth- ics argues about an issue, it addresses a reflection of what others have said. As Cohen notes, the way in which current LLMs use large data sets to predict text is very different from how we ordinarily understand human reason; nonetheless, if LLMs became very good at it, would they ""functionally"" be performing concep- tual analysis?
In their exploration of how LLMs might be used in ethics education, Rahimzadeh and colleagues (2023) list a number of ways that LLMs might aid those studying bioethics. They note that LLMs can be help- ful when ""clarifying complex concepts."" What they
might have in mind is the way which LLMs, and even search engines like Google, can very quickly explain a complex idea that would have required much more time in a tutorial or lecture to explore.
Many students new to bioethics will find identifying the formal structure of an ethical argument challenging. The following two syllogisms about the ethics of ectogenesis were requested and generated within 5 minutes. ChatGPT took a few seconds to generate these, once the question had been asked. It was asked first to write a syllogism which expresses a valid argument in favor of ectogenesis. In the second task it was asked to create a syllogism that expresses a valid argument against ectogenesis.
Syllogism 1
Premise 1: The ethical principle of bodily autonomy supports individuals' right to make choices about their own bodies and reproductive decisions. Premise 2: Ectogenesis, the process of gestating a fetus outside the human body in an artificial womb, respects and upholds bodily autonomy, as it allows individuals, particularly pregnant women, to make informed choices about their reproductive health without the physical burdens and risks associated with traditional pregnancy.
Conclusion: Therefore, ectogenesis is permissible because it aligns with the ethical principle of bodily autonomy, giving individuals the freedom to make reproductive choices without compromising their physical health and well-being.
Syllogism 2
Premise 1: The process of ectogenesis involves gestating a fetus outside the human body in an artificial womb. Premise 2: Ectogenesis raises ethical concerns about the detachment of the gestational process from the natural human reproductive system, potentially altering the fundamental dynamics of human procreation and parent-child relationships.
Conclusion: Therefore, ectogenesis should be impermissible due to its potential ethical implications,",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:23,2023-11-06 14:10:23,42–44,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,UZQYHVEQ,0.0455311973018549,0.8,0.0520985140688127

Ethical challenges with ECMO exist when conventional standards of care apply, and are exacerbated during periods of absolute ECMO scarcity when “crisis standards of care” are instituted. When conventional standards of care apply, we propose that it is ethically permissible to withhold placing patients on ECMO for reasons of technical futility or when patients have terminal, short-term prognoses that are untreatable by ECMO. Under crisis standards of care, it is ethically permissible to broaden exclusionary criteria to also withhold ECMO from patients who have a low likelihood of recovery, to maximize the overall number of lives saved. Unilateral withdrawal of ECMO against a patient’s preferences is unethical under conventional standards of care, but is ethical under crisis standards of care to increase access to ECMO to others in society. ECMO should only be rationed when true scarcity exists, and allocation protocols should be transparent to the public. When rationing must occur under crisis standards of care, it is imperative that oversight bodies assess for inequities in the allocation of ECMO and make frequent changes to improve any inequities.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:51,2023-11-06 14:09:51,13–22,Publisher: University of Chicago Press,HK85Z5ZP,0.0441176470588235,0.1666666666666666,0.0520487944655941

When combined with 3D printing, it is possible to develop and construct physical products in a wide range of geometries and materials and encapsulating a range of functionality, with minimal input from human designers. One potential application is the development of bespoke surgical tools, whereby computational design optimises a tool’s morphology for a specific patient’s anatomy and the requirements of the surgical procedure to improve surgical outcomes. This emerging application of AI and 3D printing provides an opportunity to examine whether new technologies affect the ethical responsibilities of those operating in high-consequence domains such as healthcare. This research draws on stakeholder interviews to identify how a range of different professions involved in the design, production, and adoption of computationally designed surgical tools, identify and attribute responsibility within the different stages of a computationally designed tool’s development and deployment. Those interviewed included surgeons and radiologists, fabricators experienced with 3D printing, computational designers, healthcare regulators, bioethicists, and patient advocates. Based on our findings, we identify additional responsibilities that surround the process of creating and using these tools. Additionally, the responsibilities of most professional stakeholders are not limited to individual stages of the tool design and deployment process, and the close collaboration between stakeholders at various stages of the process suggests that collective ethical responsibility may be appropriate in these cases.

There is a significant amount of research into the ethical consequences of artificial intelligence (AI). This is reflected by many outputs across academia, policy and the media. Many of these outputs aim to provide guidance to particular stakeholder groups. It has recently been shown that there is a large degree of convergence in terms of the principles upon which these guidance documents are based. Despite this convergence, it is not always clear how these principles are to be translated into practice.                                         Design/methodology/approach               In this paper, the authors move beyond the high-level ethical principles that are common across the AI ethics guidance literature and provide a description of the normative content that is covered by these principles. The outcome is a comprehensive compilation of normative requirements arising from existing guidance documents. This is not only required for a deeper theoretical understanding of AI ethics discussions but also for the creation of practical and implementable guidance for developers and users of AI.                                         Findings               In this paper, the authors therefore provide a detailed explanation of the normative implications of existing AI ethics guidelines but directed towards developers and organisational users of AI. The authors believe that the paper provides the most comprehensive account of ethical requirements in AI currently available, which is of interest not only to the research and policy communities engaged in the topic but also to the user communities that require guidance when developing or deploying AI systems.                                         Originality/value               The authors believe that they have managed to compile the most comprehensive document collecting existing guidance which can guide practical action but will hopefully also support the consolidation of the guidelines landscape.

Drawing on two illustrative case studies of schizophrenia and major depression disorder, this article identifies substantive points of contact between virtue ethics and the therapeutic strategies of recovery theory and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. In so doing, it aims to provide ways of thinking about happiness that can help therapists and people with a mental illness conceive of flourishing, not despite mental illness, but by incorporating the experience into the storied meaning of life.

In Canada, research ethics boards and researchers follow the research ethics norms of the                 Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans                 (TCPS2), and the                 National Guidelines for Research Involving Humans as Research Participants                 of Uganda (NGRU) in Uganda.

Main body               Our field experience highlights three main issues for reflection. First, we demonstrate that, in a global health research context, methodological and logistic adjustments were necessary throughout the research implementation process to ensure the protection of study participants’ privacy, especially that of people with disabilities, despite having followed the prescribed Canadian and Ugandan ethics norms. Data collection and management plans were adapted iteratively based on local realities. Second, securing financial support as a key aspect of financial management was critical to ensure privacy through disability-sensitive data collection strategies. Without adequate funding, the recruitment of research participants based on disability type, sex, and region or the hiring of local sign language interpreters would not have been possible. Third, although the TCPS2 and NGRU underscore the significance of participants’ privacy, none of these normative documents clearly express this issue in the context of global health research and disability, nor broadly discuss the ethical issue related to financial availability and management.                                         Conclusions               Conducting research in resource limited settings and with study participants with different needs calls for a nuanced and respectful implementation of research ethics in a global health context.

The hospital was under-resourced, with staff and patients experiencing lack of information and panic. The social worker, Denis Adia, recounts his responses to new and ethically challenging situations, including persuading Muslim patients to stop fasting for the good of their health; deciding to keep a baby in hospital with parents although this was against the rules; and supporting a stigmatised former patient in the face of intimidation by colleagues. He reflects on the importance of recognising each person’s unique needs and circumstances, seeing this as a vital role for social workers. The case is followed by a commentary from a UK academic (Sarah Banks), who notes the cognitive and emotional effort (‘ethics work’) undertaken by the social worker to: see the ethical aspects of particular situations; take account of patients’ specific needs; ensure they are treated with respect; promote their well-being; and perform as a good social worker.

Health care providers are exhausted, becoming ill themselves, and in some instances have died. Indeed, hospitals are struggling to find staff to care for critically ill patients most in need.

Health care providers need support, but it is not clear where that support is to come from. While much research has reported on the COVID-19-related fears of nurses and physicians, fewer studies have focused on supportive features of the hospital work environment and how it may provide relief to front-line health care providers.This purpose of this study was to explore an often-overlooked resource within hospital systems across the United States—clinical ethicists—and examine their many roles during COVID-19 and the types of ethical issues they addressed with nurses, physicians, administrators, and others.This was a primary analysis of semi-structured, qualitative interviews with 23 clinical ethicists across the United States. The interviews were conducted from November 2020–April 2021 and were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and de-identified; both inductive and deductive analyses were used to identify qualitative themes.Five major themes were identified: ethical issues that were increasingly more complex, moral distress that was “endemic,” shifting ethical paradigms from the focus on the individual to the population, fostering a supportive environment, and organizational ethics: variation in the value, roles, and policy input of clinical ethicists.Our findings report on the integral and expanded role of clinical ethicists at an unprecedented time in our nation, and how they stepped forward to support front-line clinicians in hospitals across the country.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:24,2023-11-06 14:10:24,1–14,,6GN9UXI3,0.039426523297491,0.375,0.0507567101970792

The embedding of AI in HR can be seen across key areas, including recruitment, screening and interviewing of applicants, management of workers’ tasks and schedules, evaluation of job performance, and personalized career coaching. An attractive prospect for employers is that automation and data-based decision making will lead to better decisions about hiring and management, increased efficiency, and reduction of costs. For example, AI can save countless hours in the recruitment process.Footnote 1 High application to job ratios can be reduced from hundreds to a handful at the click of a button. HR recruiters no longer have to trawl through piles of CVs, but can save their time for interviewing the very best candidates. AI-based hiring platforms claim to be able to give employers more accurate and relevant information on their applicants. These ways, the providers claim, surpass traditional recruitment techniquesFootnote 2, while increasing diversity and reducing human biasFootnote 3 (Raghavan et al., 2020). Reduction of bias in assessments is, of course, an attractive promise for both applicants and workers. Once workers are hired, they can benefit from AI-enabled personalized learning, career coaching, and round-the-clock support from chatbots (Guenole & Feinzig, 2018). Algorithms also offer efficiency on the workforce management front by automating task assignment and work performance evaluation. These are particularly attractive features for employers that manage large groups of workers and clients (Jarrahi & Sutherland, 2019).Nevertheless, the ethical issues these products raise are manifold. First, there is the question of whether these technologies work: whether they really can predict future ability, whether their hiring judgements are actually robust (replicable and not falsifiable) (Bayerischer Rundfunk, 2021). Yet, even if AI/HR technologies do what their manufacturers claim, the use of AI in HR raises significant ethical and legal concerns (Bogen & Rieke, 2018; Sánchez-Monedero et al., 2020; Tambe et al., 2019). Analogous to other applied areas of AI, these concerns include those relating to discrimination, privacy, explainability, and accountability. For job seekers and workers, multiple dimensions of human dignity are at stake, including their individual autonomy. Given the importance of work in people’s lives, these and other ethical questions surrounding the use of AI in HR are highly consequential to both individuals and society at large.This topical collection further illuminates key ethical issues that emerge when AI is applied in HR and covers approaches that can aid responsible and inclusive design practices in this domain. In their article, “A Capability Approach to Worker Dignity Under Algorithmic Management”, Laura Lamers, Jeroen Meijerink, Giedo Jansen, and Mieke Boon offer a new conceptual framework to better understand how algorithms impact the dignity of workers. Initially drawing on the capability approach developed by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, as well as Ingrid Robeyn’s notion of schematic representation, the authors study how dignity of workers can be both promoted and violated by algorithms used in HR management. The authors propose that the framework can be used to describe, analyse, and normatively evaluate specific situations, as well as aid in design of practical solutions to enhance worker dignity.Jo Ann Oravec’s “The Emergence of “Truth Machines”?: Artificial Intelligence approaches to Lie Detection” explores the emerging use of AI for lie detection in HR. The author highlights how these lie detection systems can lead to human rights issues, specifically with regard to fairness, mental privacy, and bias. Oravec concludes that technologically-based lie detection systems come at the cost of fostering of human-to-human trust and accountability within organisations. While arguing that organisations should eliminate the use of lie detection technology and focus instead on building trust and mutual respect, Oravec provides recommendations for aiding HR managers in identifying, containing, and mitigating the moral and human rights problems involved with AI-based lie detection in contexts where its use is compulsory.In “The Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence in Human Resource Management: A Decision-Making Framework”, Sarah Bankins focuses on how AI is now so widely deployed that it is used in almost every HR process, from sourcing job applicants and selecting staff, to allocating work and offering personalized career coaching. Nevertheless, such a wide remit of applicability also has the potential to generate various kinds of harm, few of which are effectively mitigated against by current guidelines. To remedy this, Bankins offers the initial steps towards a decision-making framework that is intended to support the ethical deployment of AI and guide determinations about appropriate distribution of HR tasks between humans and machines.Megan Fritts and Frank Cabrera start their article, “AI Recruitment Algorithms and the Dehumanization Problem”, by identifying what they regard as a key, yet understudied, challenge for AI-ethics – the question of whether the routine deployment of algorithms can cause dehumanisation. In particular, Fritts and Cabrera focus on how replacement of human recruiters by algorithms can be viewed as dehumanisation of the hiring process. The authors argue that this can have negative impact on substantive employee-employer and applicant-employer relationships because of the difference between the values of human recruiters and the values embedded in recruitment algorithms. As the authors highlight, addressing this issue will require making tough value trade-offs.

Josephine Yam and Joshua August Skorburg show how tricky the painstaking work of value trade-off can be in their article, “From Human Resources to Human Rights: Impact Assessments for Hiring Algorithms”. The authors suggest that the promises of using AI in hiring come at the cost of inflicting unintentional harm to human rights, including the rights to work, equality and non-discrimination, privacy, free expression and free association. The authors argue that framing ethical risks of hiring algorithms in terms of international human rights law, rather than abstract ethical principles, can help close the accountability gaps surrounding such systems. Yam and Skorburg go on to evaluate four types of algorithmic impact assessments in terms of how effectively they address the implicated human rights of job applicants and their potential to help organisations audit their algorithms and close accountability gaps.

Collectively, these contributions advance the understanding of the ethical challenges and opportunities that surround the use of AI in HR. The conceptual frameworks and practical recommendations open new avenues for further empirical research, as well as responsible and inclusive design practices in the HR domain. We, the co-editors of this topical collection, believe that the contributions highlight the need for such design practices to be grounded in direct engagement with diverse stakeholders, and in particular job seekers and workers, especially as they have the least amount of power and their voices and needs are often left unheard.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:25,2023-11-06 14:10:25,1–1,Publisher: Springer Verlag,2UJ8NLH9,0.0477502295684113,0.3333333333333333,0.0496609956848634

Findings               Being a researcher and a research subject rolled into one, as it were, presents both opportunities and challenges. To conduct responsible research from both these perspectives pose high demands on the researchers’ ethical as well as emotional capacities and responsibilities. Hopes and expectancies of the community under study might put the researcher into a dilemma, ethical aspects of anonymity and informed consent might have to be reconsidered as well as emotional challenges of engaging in and with sensitive research, all of which makes for a complex balancing act. Ethics and methods are inextricably intertwined, so are the emotional challenges of conducting sensitive research intermingled. Studying vulnerable individuals and closed communities online highlights the necessity for case and context sensitive research and for flexibility, adaptivity and mindfulness of the researcher. It also highlights the importance of discussing and questioning theoretical, methodological and ethical developments for studying everyday life practices online.                                         Originality/value               The challenges encountered in this case study contribute to the experientially grounded approach to research ethics emphasized in AoIR’s ethics guidelines. This case offers an opportunity to explore and discuss complex issues arising from the researcher’s insider position in a closed group devoted to the sensitive topic of supporting bereaved parents. Further, it highlights the necessity for research to be case and context sensitive as well as for the researcher and the research design to be flexible and adaptive. Research on vulnerable communities also heightens the demands of ethical responsibility of the researcher and the research process.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:11,2023-11-06 14:05:11,409–423,,CXYU7PV6,0.0505050505050505,0.0,0.0490932193600554

However, the burgeoning scholarship argues that there are ethical challenges relating to this new technology, not the least related to privacy, which affects the technology’s acceptance. Given that the media impacts public opinion and acceptance of VA and that there are no studies on media coverage of VA, the study focuses on media coverage. In addition, this study aims to focus on media coverage in Indonesia, a country that has been underrepresented in earlier research.                                         Design/methodology/approach               The authors used critical discourse analysis of media texts, focusing on three levels (text, discourse practice and social practice) to study how VA technology was discussed in the Indonesian context and what power relations frame the representation. In total, 501 articles were collected from seven national media in Indonesia from 2010 to 2020 and the authors particularly focus on the 45 articles that concern ethics.                                         Findings               The ethical topics covered are gender issues, false marketing, ethical wrongdoing, ethically positive effects, misuse, privacy and security. More importantly, when they are discussed, they are presented as constituting no real critical problem.

In diagnostic imaging, for instance, a good decision involves diagnosing cancer if and only if the patient has cancer. In clinical ethics, good decision- making is defined in terms of the extent to which the following two goals are met:
1. Accuracy: The decision is the right one, where the ""right"" decision is that which best aligns with relevant justifying values, principles and their respective weights as they apply to the case at hand.
2. Transparency: The patients are provided with an explanation of the decision in terms of relevant values, principles and how they are weighed. In other words, the patients are offered reasons that explain and justify the decision.
For the use of artificial intelligence in clinical ethics to be ethically justified, it should improve the trans- parency and accuracy of ethical decision-making beyond that which physicians and ethics committees are currently capable of providing
The kind of AI proposed by Meier and colleagues (2022) has the fascinating potential to improve the transparency of ethical decision-making, at least if it is used as a decision aid rather than a decision
replacement (Savulescu & Maslen 2015). While artifi- cial intelligence cannot itself engage in the human communicative process of justifying its decisions to patients, the AI they describe (unlike ""black-box"" AI) makes explicit which values and principles are involved and how much weight they are given.
By contrast, the moral principles or values underly- ing human moral intuition are not always consciously, introspectively accessible (Cushman, Young, and Hauser 2006). While humans sometimes have a fuzzy, intuitive sense of some of the factors that are relevant to their moral judgment, we often have strong moral
intuitions without being sure of their source, or with- out being clear on precisely how strongly different factors played a role in generating the intuitions. But if clinicians make use of the AI as a decision aid, this could help them to transparently and precisely com- municate the actual reasons behind their decision.
This is so even if the Al's recommendation is ultimately rejected. Suppose, for example, that the AI recommends a course of action, with a certain amount of confidence, and it specifies the exact values or weights it has assigned to autonomy versus benefi- cence in coming to this conclusion. Evaluating the recommendation made by the AI could help a com- mittee make more explicit the ""black box"" aspects of their own reasoning. For example, the committee might decide that beneficence should actually be weighted more heavily in this case than the AI sug- gests. Being able to understand the reason that their decision diverges from that of the AI gives them the opportunity to offer a further justifying reason as to why they think beneficence should be given more weight; and this, in turn, could improve the transpar- ency of their recommendation.
However, the potential for the kind of AI described in the target article to improve the accuracy of moral decision-making may be more limited. This is so for two reasons. Firstly, whether AI can be expected to outperform human decision-making depends in part on the metrics used to train it. In non-ethical domains, superior accuracy can be achieved because the ""verdicts"" given to the AI in the training phase are not solely the human judgments that the AI is intended to replace or inform. Consider how AI can learn to detect lung cancer from scans at a superior rate to human radiologists after being trained on large datasets and being ""told"" which scans show cancer and which ones are cancer-free. Importantly, this training includes cases where radiologists did not rec- ognize cancer in the early scans themselves, but where",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:47,2023-11-06 14:09:47,1–3,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,VQNZPCXH,0.0426229508196721,0.5,0.0486628859590291

The first was the possibility that life-saving resources could be overwhelmed. Early reports from hospitals in the Italian city of Bergamo suggested that ventilatory support might need rationing and emergency ‘battlefield’ triage was a real possibility.1 In the UK, several professional bodies, including the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Physicians rapidly developed guidance for doctors should triage become a reality.2 The second issue was the acute shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Where doctors were unable to protect their patients – and themselves – from the risk of COVID-19, ethical challenges emerged. Ordinarily, doctors and patients do not present risks of significant harm to each other. To shift to a position where every patient – and every health professional – could potentially be a threat presented serious clinical and ethical challenges. To treat with inadequate PPE, so options for mitigating harms are radically reduced, deepens the challenges. Among the questions the BMA wrestled with was the extent of doctors’ duties to treat infected or potentially infected patients in the absence of effective PPE. The BMA was clear that despite obligations to treat, medicine is not a self-sacrificing profession: there were limits to the risk doctors could be required to expose themselves to.3
These issues no longer seem so pressing. In the UK at least, there is adequate PPE and with the second steep wave behind us, and significant numbers vaccinated, it is less likely that triage will be required in the UK. But as those concerns have receded so other ethical questions have arisen. Among them is a cluster of issues associated with what might be called COVID-19’s indirect harms.

Therefore, to help understand some of that scope it is essential to incorporate a range of perspectives, from a range of stakeholders, on current and emerging ethical challenges associated with computer technology. This study aims to achieve this by using, a three-pronged, stakeholder analysis of Computer Science academics, ICT industry professionals, and citizen groups was undertaken to explore what they consider to be crucial computing ethics concerns. The overlap between these stakeholder groups are explored, as well as whether their concerns are reflected in the existing literature.                                         Design/methodology/approach               Data collection was performed using focus groups, and the data was analysed using a thematic analysis. The data was also analysed to determine if there were overlaps between the literature and the stakeholders’ concerns and attitudes towards computing ethics.                                         Findings               The results of the focus group analysis show a mixture of overlapping concerns between the different groups, as well as some concerns that are unique to each of the specific groups. All groups stressed the importance of data as a key topic in computing ethics. This includes concerns around the accuracy, completeness and representativeness of data sets used to develop computing applications. Academics were concerned with the best ways to teach computing ethics to university students. Industry professionals believed that a lack of diversity in software teams resulted in important questions not being asked during design and development. Citizens discussed at length the negative and unexpected impacts of social media applications. These are all topics that have gained broad coverage in the literature.                                         Social implications               In recent years, the impact of ICT on society and the environment at large has grown tremendously. From this fast-paced growth, a myriad of ethical concerns have arisen. The analysis aims to shed light on what a diverse group of stakeholders consider the most important social impacts of technology and whether these concerns are reflected in the literature on computing ethics. The outcomes of this analysis will form the basis for new teaching content that will be developed in future to help illuminate and address these concerns.

The paper begins with an explication of the rights-based normative framework of the argument, including conceptual analysis of the terms ‘agency’, ‘potentiality for agency’ and ‘gradual approach of agency’. It critically examines Alan Gewirth’s account of the criteria for being a rights bearer and principles for settling rights conflicts between agents and potential agents. It then applies the rights-based normative framework to the ethical challenges associated with care for congenitally decorticate children. It argues that recent empirical studies support the claim that the concepts ‘potential for agency’ and ‘capacity for rudimentary agency’ apply to children who are born without major parts of their cerebral cortex.

The authors propose a process, whereby AI-DSS would provide a physician a second opinion, and when there is a mismatch between opinions, another physician would provide a third opinion. This approach maintains a ‘physician-in-charge’ perspective, and suggests that decision-making must ultimately be made by a person. This approach is also consistent with the ‘physician in-the-loop’ concept, such that even when increasingly autonomous AI-DSSs are put to use, physicians will still be providing checks and overseeing clinical decisions.The authors conceptualise AI as a replacement of human cognitive labour.

RDM lapses in medical science can result in questionable data and cause the public’s confidence in the scientific community to crumble. A fledgling medical school in a young university in Singapore has mandated every funded research project to have a data management plan (DMP). However, researchers’ adherence to their DMPs was unknown until the school embarked on routine data auditing. We hypothesize that research data auditing improves RDM awareness, compliance and reception in the school.                                         Methods               We conducted surveys with research PIs and researchers before and after data auditing to evaluate differences in self-reported RDM awareness, compliance and reception. As it is mandatory to deposit research data in a central data repository system in the school, we tracked data deposition by each laboratory from 2 weeks before to 3 months after data auditing as a marker of actual RDM compliance.                                         Results               Research data auditing had an overall positive effect on self-reported RDM awareness, compliance and reception for both research PIs and researchers. Research PIs agreed more that RDM was important to scientific reproducibility, were more aware of proper RDM, had higher RDM strength in their laboratories and were more compliant with the DMP. Both research PIs and researchers believed data auditing helped them to be more compliant with data deposition in the repository. However, data auditing had no significant impact on laboratories’ data deposition rates over time, which could be due to the short sampling period.                                         Conclusions               Research PIs and researchers generally felt that data auditing was effective in improving RDM practices. It helped to evaluate their RDM practices objectively, propose corrective actions for RDM lapses and spread awareness of the university’s data management policies. Our findings corroborated other studies in medical research, geosciences, engineering and ethics that data auditing promotes good RDM practices.

Within undergraduate healthcare education of doctors, nurses, and allied professions, rapid shifts to distance learning and pedagogic content creation within new realities, demands of healthcare practice settings, shortened curricula, and/or earlier graduation have also challenged ethics teaching in terms of curriculum allotments or content specification. We propose expanding the notion of resilience to the field of ethics education under the conditions of remote learning. Educational resilience starts in the virtual classroom of ethics teaching, initially constituted as an “unpurposed space” of exchange about the pandemic’s challenging impact on students and educators. This continuously transforms into “purposed space” of reflection, discovering ethics as a repertory of orientative knowledge for addressing the pandemic’s challenges on personal, professional, societal, and global levels and for discovering (and then addressing) that the health of individuals and populations also has moral determinants. As such, an educational resilience framework with inherent adaptability rises to the challenge of supporting the moral agency of students acting both as professionals and as global citizens. Educational resilience is key in supporting and sustaining professional identify formation and facilitating the development of students’ moral resilience and leadership amid moral complexity and potential moral transgression—not only but especially in times of pandemic.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:12,2023-11-06 14:05:12,58–65,,LXQHQN4E,0.0363636363636363,0.2,0.0446077648186611

Multiple empirical studies have explored patients' and the public's attitudes toward approaches to consent for pragmatic research. Questions remain, however, about how to use the resulting empirical data in resolving normative and policy debates and what kind of data warrants the most consideration. We recommend prioritizing data about what people consider acceptable with respect to consent for pragmatic research and data about people's informed, rather than initial, preferences on this subject. In addition, we advise caution regarding the weight given to majority viewpoints and identify circumstances when empirical data can be overridden.

The use of Advance Euthanasia Directives (AED) is suggested as a way to deal with end-of-life wishes of persons with dementia. However, in the Netherlands—the only country in which this practice is legal—the experiences of patients, doctors, and relatives have been far from satisfactory.             Our paper analyses this complex ethical challenge from a Dignity-Enhancing Care approach, starting from the Dutch experiences with AED as a case. We first consider the lived experiences of the different stakeholders, seeking out a dialogical-interpretative understanding of care. We aim to promote human dignity as a normative standard for end-of-life care practices. Three concrete proposals are then presented in which this approach can be operationalised in order to deal respectfully with the end-of-life choices of persons with dementia.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:51,2023-11-06 14:09:51,907–914,,FB6HQDRC,0.0465116279069767,0.0,0.0438982434086473

As the essay explains, Fabre arrives at this position by treating TECHINT as a like-for-like replacement for HUMINT. The essay argues instead that TECHINT is unlikely to act as a like-for-like replacement for HUMINT. As such, TECHINT might transform existing practices of espionage and counterintelligence, giving rise to new ethical challenges not captured in Fabre's analysis. To illustrate the point, the essay builds an analogy between TECHINT and recent armed conflicts in which precision weapons have been deployed. Although precision weapons seem ethically desirable, their availability has created new practices of waging war that are ethically problematic. By analogy, TECHINT, though not intrinsically undesirable, has the capacity to generate new practices of intelligence gathering that are ethically problematic—potentially more than HUMINT. Ultimately, recent negative experiences with the use of precision weaponry should caution against an overly positive assessment of TECHINT's ethical desirability.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:28,2023-11-06 14:10:28,147–160,,YREIC925,0.0462184873949579,0.0,0.0435575982583271

Although different countries have proposed different guidelines to manage this emergency, these proposed criteria do not sufficiently consider people living with disabilities. People living with disabilities are therefore at a higher risk of exclusion from medical treatments as physicians tend to assume they have poor quality of life, whereas access to medical treatment should be based on several parameters, including clinical data and prognosis. However, the COVID-19 pandemic shifts the medical paradigm from person-centred medicine to community-centred medicine, challenging the main ethical theories.

Likewise, in the physical world, ML models are critical components in autonomous agents such as robotic surgeons and self-driving cars. Among the many ethical dimensions that arise in the use of ML technology in such applications, analyzing morally permissible actions is both immediate and profound. For example, there is the potential for learned algorithms to become biased against certain groups. More generally, in so much that the decisions of ML models impact society, both virtually (e.g., denying a loan) and physically (e.g., driving into a pedestrian), notions of accountability, blame and responsibility need to be carefully considered. In this article, we advocate for a two-pronged approach ethical decision-making enabled using rich models of autonomous agency: on the one hand, we need to draw on philosophical notions of such as beliefs, causes, effects and intentions, and look to formalise them, as attempted by the knowledge representation community, but on the other, from a computational perspective, such theories need to also address the problems of tractable reasoning and (probabilistic) knowledge acquisition. As a concrete instance of this tradeoff, we report on a few preliminary results that apply (propositional) tractable probabilistic models to problems in fair ML and automated reasoning of moral principles. Such models are compilation targets for certain types of knowledge representation languages, and can effectively reason in service some computational tasks. They can also be learned from data. Concretely, current evidence suggests that they are attractive structures for jointly addressing three fundamental challenges: reasoning about possible worlds + tractable computation + knowledge acquisition. Thus, these seems like a good starting point for modelling reasoning robots as part of the larger ecosystem where accountability and responsibility is understood more broadly.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:24,2023-11-06 14:10:24,1–12,Publisher: Springer Verlag,3Z5ZNBX6,0.0290322580645161,0.4,0.043191332184191

Although criminological datasets are used to study and document the extent of such disparities, they often lack key information, including arrestees’ racial identification. As AI technologies are increasingly used by criminal justice agencies to make predictions about outcomes in bail, policing, and other decision-making, a growing literature suggests that the current implementation of these systems may perpetuate racial inequalities. In this paper, we argue that AI technologies should be investigated to understand how they recognize racial categories and whether they can be harnessed to fill missing race data. By bridging this gap, we can work towards better understanding racial inequalities in a wide range of contexts, most notably criminal justice. Using a multidisciplinary perspective, we rethink the design and methodology used in facial processing technology (FPT) based on supervised deep learning model (DLM) image classification. By modifying standard FPT pipelines to tackle multiple sources of DLM bias, we propose an experimental methodology based on ethical AI principles to generate binary (Black and White) racial categories using mugshots. We go beyond simply reporting DLM accuracies and address fundamental issues such as generalizability and interpretability by using a “self-auditing” approach. First, we evaluate the inference performances of 42 fine-tuned DLMs using unseen test images from the same dataset but subject to varying data augmentations. Next, to interpret and validate our methodological approach, we apply gradient-based saliency maps to assess the consistency of facial region relevance and attribution. Finally, drawing upon insights from three areas (computer science, sociology, and law), we investigate the efficacy of our DLM-based method as a tool for detecting racial inequalities in criminal justice.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:27,2023-11-06 14:10:27,897–918,,YHJDNE2J,0.0422535211267605,0.05,0.0428224311225319

In this article I wonder whether the lessons we have learned in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic can be applied to climate change mitigation. My first argument is that at least some of the ethical successes obtained at the individual level can be repeated with respect to climate change, but only if we stop focusing solely on the risks of climate change and offer a convincing picture of the benefits and opportunities of a more sustainable world. The second argument is that the Covid-19 pandemic offered us a new perspective on the relationship between global systemic threats and social justice: no one can adapt in isolation, neither medically nor economically.

Nutritional care for older adults in institutions represents a particularly important area to address in nursing education and practice, as the right to food can be at risk and health personnel experience ethical challenges related to food and nutrition. Objective: The present study investigates the development of coursework on nutritional care with a human rights perspective in a nursing programme for first-year nursing students and draws upon reflections and lessons learned. Research design: The study utilized educational design research. The coursework, developed through two rounds, combined on-campus learning and clinical placement in nursing homes. Nursing studentsʼ perspectives and experiences gathered through focus groups and a written assignment informed the development and evaluation of the coursework. Participants and research context: In the first round, multistage focus group interviews were conducted with 18 nursing students before, during and after placement. In the second round, four focus group interviews with 26 nursing students were conducted shortly after placement. Ethical consideration: The study was approved by the Norwegian Centre for Research Data. Findings: Three main ʽlessons learnedʼ emerged regarding introducing a human rights perspective in nursing education: 1) the contribution of the human rights perspective in changing the narrative of ʽvulnerable and malnourished patientsʼ, 2) the importance of relationships and experiences for learning about human rights and 3) the benefit of combining development of ethical competence with a human rights perspective.

When PCTs are con- ducted in a reciprocal cycle of knowledge generation and care improvement, they also contribute signifi- cantly to fulfilling the goals of a learning health care system (Committee on the Learning Health Care System in America, and Institute of Medicine 2013; Faden et al. 2013). The potential of PCTs to drive health care improvement stems in part from differen- ces in design from explanatory trials, including most notably the ways in which some PCTs are embedded more or less seamlessly into routine clinical care. However, these differences can also raise different eth- ical challenges from those conventionally addressed in research ethics, which has focused heavily on trad- itional explanatory trials. In this issue of the journal, both Garland and colleagues and Morain and Largent address two such ethical challenges, presenting thoughtful suggestions for the ethical conduct of embedded PCTs (Garland, Morain, and Sugarman 2023; Morain and Largent 2023).
One challenge for PCTs is securing support from clinicians for embedding research in their practices. Garland and colleagues take the position that everyday clinicians have an ethical obligation to participate in PCTs. They bootstrap their argument by appealing to two other moral obligations: the duty of clinicians to provide high-quality care and the broader duty of clinicians to contribute to advancing biomedical knowledge. The authors then interrogate their position for possible exceptions to this professional duty and describe several contexts in which clinicians could defensibly decline participation (Garland, Morain, and Sugarman 2023). Complementing this work, the art- icle by Morain and Largent identifies a critical issue in embedded research that is likely to become of only greater importance-what should happen when clinic- ally relevant information is identified in embedded research where informed consent has been justifiably waived and patients are thus likely unaware that their data are being used in research activities such as PCTs? The authors show how morally relevant dis- tinctions between traditional explanatory research and embedded research mean that the strategies advocated for the handling of incidental findings in conventional RCTs are not sufficient when similar challenges emerge in embedded research, and raise some helpful suggestions for an ethical path forward (Morain and Largent 2023).",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:25,2023-11-06 14:10:25,1–4,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,6UC4AEDU,0.0379746835443038,0.1818181818181818,0.041856749888507

The authors consider several ethical arguments, but their conclusion ultimately hinges on a single assump- tion: that withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining therapies are ethically equivalent. Thus, if one does not automatically withdraw ECMO from a patient whose course evolves into a bridge to nowhere, one could not withhold ECMO from a decompensating patient even when knowing at the outset that ECMO could not bridge to a sustainable destination (gener- ally recovery, transplant, or durable mechanical device). Conversely, if ECMO is systematically with- held from patients who are highly unlikely to reach a sustainable destination, ECMO must then immediately be withdrawn from all patients who unexpectedly end up on a bridge to nowhere.
This conclusion is fundamentally flawed. The axio- matic position that withholding and withdrawing life- sustaining treatment are ethically equivalent and must therefore be managed identically is indefensible. A coherent ethical argument supports intentionally avoiding a bridge to nowhere by primarily withhold- ing ECMO in such cases, while also compassionately supporting patients who nevertheless land on an
ECMO bridge to nowhere rather than unilaterally dis- continuing it.
The authors did not invent this equivalence thesis. Withdrawing life-sustaining treatment is widely con- sidered ethically and legally equivalent to withholding it (Cantor 2001), yet any bedside clinician involved in life-sustaining treatments recognizes this as a false equivalency, particularly when there is any conflict between patient or family and clinicians regarding the decision. As the authors describe, the equivalence the- sis evolved pragmatically, to permit clinicians' initi- ation of therapies without committing to their indefinite continuation (Cameron, Savulescu, and Wilkinson 2020). Reverse engineering an ethical pos- ition to achieve a desired result, however, risks formu- lating indefensible arguments. The American Medical Association Code of Ethics declares that ""while there may be an emotional difference between not initiating an intervention at all and discontinuing it later in the course of care, there is no ethical difference between withholding and withdrawing treatment"" (American Medical Association 2016). This formulation belies the fact that the emotional difference in fact reflects a key ethical distinction.
The arguments that Childress et al. advance against ECMO as destination therapy best apply before its ini- tiation. The standard of care for ECMO utilization is still evolving, and each institution develops unique protocols. Institutions may appropriately consider arguments from distributive justice in developing can- didacy criteria. Resource stewardship determinations involve not only financial, staffing, and space consid- erations, but also consider the moral distress and posi- tions of those providing and receiving care.

Community researchers were recruited by a not-for-profit organisation, with the aim of both discovering the reasons for vaccine hesitancy and encouraging take-up. This raised issues about the roles and responsibilities of local researchers in their own communities, where they might be blamed for adverse reactions to vaccination. They and their mentor struggled with balancing societal protection against individual rights to make choices. These themes are explored in two commentaries discussing the difficulties in balancing ethics in public health (prioritising societal benefits), social research (protecting participants from harm and respecting their rights not to be involved) and participatory research practices (maximising democratic participation and decision-making). As discussed in the first commentary, often these cohere, but tensions can arise. The second commentary also raises the issue of epistemic justice, questioning the extent to which the villagers could have a say in the design, implementation and interpretation of the research, and the dangers of not hearing the voices and arguments of people who reject vaccination. The case and commentaries highlight the complexities of PAR and additional challenges in a public health context.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:27,2023-11-06 14:10:27,221–228,,PYH333NI,0.0297029702970297,0.1666666666666666,0.0415480048965819

There are several competing ethical obligations to consider: the ethical obligation to maternal autonomy, the maternal and fetal beneficence-based obligations to treat peripartum psychosis, and the fetal beneficence-based obligation to minimize teratogenic exposure. Objective: This article outlines an ethical framework for clinical decision-making for the management of chronic psychosis in pregnancy, with an emphasis on special considerations in the previable and periviable period. Case Presentation: A 31-year-old gravida 2, para 1 with intrauterine pregnancy at 12 weeks and 4 days gestation was brought to the emergency department by her husband seven months after delivering her first child, due to sudden onset of behavioral changes that included self-isolation, not eating, and not taking care of her child. Her past medical history included hypothyroidism and inflammatory bowel disease, but no prior psychiatric illness. After being admitted to the psychiatric hospital, she continued to have poor oral intake and weight loss despite initial inpatient treatment with antipsychotics, levothyroxine, and discontinuation of corticosteroids. Her pregnancy was also complicated by the diagnosis of multiple fetal anomalies at 20 weeks gestation, when the fetus was periviable. Conclusions: For previable or periviable pregnancies, the patient and/or surrogate should decide whether to pursue prenatal genetic screening and invasive diagnostic testing, as well as whether to continue or terminate the pregnancy. When the choice is made to continue the pregnancy, initiation of long-term psychiatric treatment (including medications with potential adverse fetal effects) should be based on shared decision-making between the physician and the patient and/or surrogate. Although some pharmacologic interventions may have potential adverse effects on the developing fetus, the use of psychotropic medications can be ethically justified, even if the patient herself does not have the capacity to consent and requires a surrogate, when the goal is to restore maternal autonomy and minimize the risks of maternal and fetal harm from untreated psychiatric illness.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:28,2023-11-06 14:10:28,113–119,,9SYHDWNG,0.0337423312883435,0.25,0.0414180058691122

This burden for justification can be understood as an increased responsibility. In contrast, such burden does allegedly not arise, when physicians agree in their judgement. Second, in those medical contexts where humans collaborate with humans such justification can be provided, since human experts can discuss the evidence and reasons that have led them to their judgement, through which the sources of disagreement can be found and a justified decision can be made by the physician in charge. Third, unlike human-to-human collaboration, such communicative exchange is not possible with an AI system. Due to AI’s opacity, the physician in charge has no means of illuminating why the AI disagrees. Conclusively, the authors propose RoD as a solution. RoD suggests that a second human expert should be consulted for advise in cases of human–AI disagreement. Once AI systems become more widespread in clinical practice, it can be expected that such type of disagreement occurs more frequently. AI, after all, is being implemented, because it promises, among others, higher accuracy, which implies that some abnormalities will be detected that the physician would have missed.2 Hence, it is laudable to discuss the moral implications of … ",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:51,2023-11-06 14:09:51,230–231,,DXV5ZHQC,0.0406779661016949,0.0,0.0391054709726365

Although understanding the ethical dilemmas about the duty to care among nurses is necessary to allow effective preparation, few studies have explored these concerns.                                         Aim:               This study aimed to identify the ethical dilemmas among clinical nurses in Spain and Chile. It primarily aimed to (1) identify nurses’ agreement with the duty to care despite high risks for themselves and/or their families, (2) describe nurses’ well-being and (3) describe the associations between well-being and the duty to care.                                         Research design:               Cross-sectional self-reported anonymous data were collected between May and June 2020 via electronic survey distribution (snowball sampling).                                         Ethical considerations:               The Institutional Ethical Review Committees in both countries approved the study (CHUC_2020_33 and 27/2020).                                         Findings:               In total, 345 clinical nurses answered the primary question about the duty to care for the sick. Although in the total sample 77.4% agreed they have a duty to care for the sick, significant differences were found between the Spanish and Chilean samples. Overall, 53.6% of the nurses reported low levels of well-being; however, among those reporting low well-being, statistically significant differences were found between Spanish and Chilean nurses as 19.4% and 37.8%, respectively, disagreed with the statement regarding the duty to care.                                         Discussion:               Participants in both countries reported several ethical dilemmas, safety fears, consequent stress and low well-being.

If, however, the AI-DSS and physician disagree, then a second physician’s opinion is called on to resolve the dispute. While the cognitive labour of the decision is shared between the physicians and AI, the final decision remains at the discretion of the first physician, and with it the moral and legal culpability.The putative benefits of this approach are twofold: (1) healthcare administration can improve diagnostic performance by introducing AI-DSS without the unintended byproduct of a responsibility gap, and (2) assuming the physician and AI disagree less than the general rate of requested second opinions, and the AI’s diagnostic accuracy supersedes or at least … ",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:50,2023-11-06 14:09:50,234–235,,NEYMFYQ4,0.0368663594470046,0.0454545454545454,0.0376771695545488

How should human beings and robots interact with one another? Nyholm’s
answer to this question is given below in the form of a conditional:
If a robot looks or behaves like an animal or a human being then we
should treat them with a degree of moral consideration (p. 201).
Although this is not a novel claim in the literature on ai ethics, what is new is
the reason Nyholm gives to support this claim; we should treat robots that look
like human or non-human animals with a certain degree of moral restraint
out of respect for human beings or other beings with moral status. Although
Danaher or Coeckelbergh also claim that we should treat robots with a degree
of moral consideration, the reasons they give for making this claim focus on
duties or rights attaching to the robot themselves (see J. Danaher, “Welcoming
Robots into the Moral Circle: A Defence of Ethical Behaviourism,” Science
and Engineering Ethics, (2019): 1–27 or M. Coeckelbergh, “Moral Appearances:
Emotions, Robots and Human Morality,” Ethics and Information Technology,
12(3) (2010): 235–241.). Nyholm disagrees with this type of reasoning and
claims that until robots develop a human or animal like inner life, we have no
direct duties to the robots themselves. Rather, it is out of respect for human
beings or other beings with moral status that we should treat some robots
with moral restraint. Gerdes, similarly inspired by Kant, focuses on the human
agent to argue that we should avoid treating robots in cruel ways because this
may corrupt the human agent’s character (see A. Gerdes, “The Issue of Moral
Consideration in Robot Ethics,” siggas Computers and Society, 45(3) (2015):
274–279.). Nyholm’s contribution here is to extend this view such that the cor-
ruption or harm being done is against the humanity in all of us.
Throughout the book Nyholm does not aim to give a precise definition of
what a robot is or could be; instead, he uses examples of existing robots rather
than examples of robots that may be manufactured sometime in the future.
Nyholm is right to stress the need to re-evaluate answers given to the question
of human-robot interaction by focusing on existing robots.The examples he
uses cover a broad variety from humanoids to self-driving cars to autonomous
weapons systems used in the military (chapters 1–4).
The book can be divided in three separate parts: In the first part (chapters 1
and 2), Nyholm argues that to determine the ethics of human-ai interaction we
should not simply apply ethical codes or principles developed on the basis of

book reviews222
human-human interaction. Traditional ethical theories may be used as a basis
but these need to be expanded or adapted to match the fact that robots are not
humans. In the second part of the book (chapters 3 and 4), Nyholm uses the
examples of self-driving cars and military robots to discuss issues relating to
appointing responsibility and ensuring useful collaborations between humans
and robots. In the third part of the book (chapters 5–8), Nyholm deals with the
question of human-robot relationships and more specifically the possibility of
developing friendship relationships and treating robots with a degree of moral
consideration.
Chapters 1 and 2 provide support for the claim that, as this is the first time in
human evolution and history that this interaction arises, we need to base our
behaviour on a knowledge of human minds and human agency as well as on
a knowledge of robot minds and robot agency. One key suggestion underlying
Nyholm’s main view is that to determine the right way to interact with robots
we need to have a good idea of both their nature and capabilities for agency as
well as our nature and our tendency to attribute mental states to entities we
interact with.
In chapters 3 and 4, Nyholm uses the examples of self-driving cars and mil-
itary robots to make two important claims: 1) Cases of self-driving cars show
that sometimes we should not focus on making robots adapt or mimic human
behaviour; instead, it may be more beneficial for humans to adopt their behav-
iour to be closer to robots to avoid human-robot coordination issues, e.g. to
encourage safer driving behaviour. 2) In cases where it is difficult to hold some-
one responsible, e.g. car crashes by self-driving cars or actions performed by
semi-autonomous weapons systems, any responsibility gaps can be filled by
bringing in the concept of collaborative agency.
In chapter 5 he raises concerns relating to the possibility of deception,
exploitation and the danger of replacing human contact with robot contact

tionships is appearance or behaviour, what he calls ‘ethical behaviourism.’
Although in chapter 6 he accepts that robots can have minds and attributing
mental states to them is not always a complete mistake, he claims that a robot
mind should not be confused with the mind of a human or a non-human ani-
mal (p. 145).
In chapter 7 he goes through some major ethical views (Virtue Ethics,
Kantian, Consequentialist) to argue that all these accounts presuppose that
robots need to be good in the sense of having virtues, or acting out of rea-
sons, or being blameworthy so that they enter into relationships of friend-
ship or love with human beings. He argues that robots cannot be good on the

Older adults, who have not grown up with digital innovation, are expected to keep up with technological shifts as much as other age groups. This is ethically challenging, as it may threaten a sense of dignity and well-being in older adults.                                         Research objective               To clarify the phenomenon of sense of dignity experienced in older adults, concerning how their expectations and needs are met within the context of digitally led healthcare in Norway.                                         Research design               A Reflective Lifeworld Research design was chosen, and purposive, in-depth interviews were conducted.                                         Participants and research context               The participants were 13 adults 75 years and older from Northern Norway, living at home and not receiving consistent assistance.

However, the frequency of suboptimal referrals is widely reported. This research reviews the literature to illuminate the challenges suboptimal referrals present to the delivery of care in radiology departments. The concept of suboptimal referral includes information, that is; missing, insufficient, inconsistent, misleading, hard to interpret or wrong. The research uses the four ethical principles of               non-maleficence, beneficence, Autonomy               and               Justice               as an analytic framework.                                         Suboptimal referrals can cause               harm               by hindering safe contrast-media administration, proper radiation protection by justification of procedures, and compassionate patient care. Suboptimal referrals also hinder promoting patient               benefits               from the correct choice of imaging modality and protocol, an optimal performed examination, and an accurate radiology report. Additionally, patient               autonomy               is compromised from the lack of information needed to facilitate benefit–risk communication. Finally, suboptimal referrals challenge               justice               based on lack of reasonable patient prioritising and the unfairness caused by unnecessary examinations.                          These findings illuminate how suboptimal referrals can inhibit good health and well-being for patients in relation to safety, missed opportunities, patient anxiety and dissatisfaction. The ethical challenges identified calls for solutions. Referral-decision support tools and artificial intelligence may improve referral quality, when implemented.

This collection of three articles addresses ""knowledge gaps"" from the previous study and focuses on changes in EC practices since 2000, volume, and practitioners' opinions on improvement. The results of the study suggest a ""good news, bad news scenario"": ECs are more common and more active, but previous causes for concern related to consult numbers, training, and evaluation persist or have worsened. Further, the study finds significant disparities between high and low EC utilizer organiza- tions with regard to recognition/implementation of published guidelines and perceived adequacy of resources. Though the study was descriptive, not evaluative, it would be easy to read the reported results collectively as an indictment of the field, of the professionals and organizations working toward improvement, and of the very value of EC.
Underlying both the research and most of the com- mentaries is a fundamental assumption about the inherent value of EC. Ethics consultation is a good thing, though it may benefit from various efforts at improvement. Before attempting to consider what this means, I should provide a disclaimer. I have served as a volunteer in many leadership roles within the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities (ASBH) and the Healthcare Ethics Consultation Certification Commission (HCEC Commission), I have received the HEC-C credential, and have worked professionally in both academic and community-based roles with the responsibility for providing EC. The views offered here are my own and do not represent any of these affiliations, though undoubtedly will reflect that collective experience. This constellation of experiences and the reasons that compelled me into graduate study of bioethics reveal a significant bias
favoring the value of EC and the establishment of standards to assure quality, a bias that appears to be largely shared by the international group of authors who contributed the commentaries, those who are likely among the ""enthusiasts"" described by Crites and Cunningham (2022). That said, I believe there are some basic questions about EC that remain stubbornly unanswered, even with the wealth of data generated by this study and the vast literature on ethics consult- ation. There is an indictment to be made, but not against the value of EC.
Since the organic rise of ethics committees and EC from the 1960s, theologians, philosophers, and a var- iety of others--though none who referred to them- selves as ""bioethicists"" or ""clinical ethics consultants""-have engaged in efforts to make sense of the benefits and burdens of expanding clinical treatment opportunities. Legal decisions, presidential commissions, medical professional organizations, and the Joint Commission supported and implicitly lent authority to EC practices. The ASBH, and its prede- cessor organizations, recognized ethics consultants and committee members as a key constituency and took the initial steps toward professionalizing the field. The 1998 and 2011 Core Competencies (ASBH 1998; ASBH 2011), with a third edition in progress, the 2014 Code of Ethics (ASBH 2014), and the cre- ation of the HCEC Commission in 2018 are hallmarks of professionalization. They reflect a path common among other fields, including many within health care, with varying timelines.
The current study by Fox and colleagues affirms that the practice of EC is growing, though perhaps professional maturation is not (yet) aligned with that growth. Perceptions of the need for EC appear con- sistent with the varied rates of utilization and growth. This suggests a stunted or at least bifurcated profes- sionalization process.

Sisela Bok remarks:If there is no confidence in the truthfulness of others, is there any way to assess their fairness, their intentions to help or to harm? How, then, can they be trusted? Whatever matters to human beings, trust is the atmosphere in which it thrives.1 p31The idea that trust in what others tell us is the bedrock on which human relationships and other values are built seems plausible, but how trust is created, nurtured and sustained is perhaps the challenge for medical ethics. Annette Baier noted that trust occurs within the context of a relationship of some sort, be that with another person or an institution.“Trust me!” is for most of us an invitation which we cannot accept at will—either we do already trust the one who says it, in which case it serves at best as reassurance…2 p244Giving thought to the function of trust, both between individuals and toward an institution can shed light on why it occurs and is needed. Niklaus Lumann observes that there is a conceptual relationship between trust and vulnerability: trust is a way of controlling for the uncertainties that the future holds. The need to trust therefore follows from the fact that the future contains many more possibilities than could ever be realised in the present.3 The idea that vulnerability about what might happen in the future explains the need for trust, chimes naturally with how we can view many relationships within healthcare. In mental health settings whether or not a mental health worker is thought ‘trustworthy’. often determines whether or not that relationship is recovery oriented.4
The Journal of Medical Ethics has published a number of papers in recent years on the concept of epistemic injustice, which occurs when the testimony of someone, often a patient, is not given the credibility that it should.5 6 We can view epistemic injustice via the lens of trust and vulnerability too: when someone’s experiences are not heard, it undermines the likelihood that they will expect a therapeutic response to their future vulnerabilities.In this issue of the JME, Priest discusses the significance of trusting the testimony of non-binary adults seeking puberty suppression. She claims:Medicine’s ethically insecure history within the LGBT community justifies scepticism towards physicians’ scepticism of LGBT testimony…we must remember that both values and experience can impact suffering. Judging norm deviant preferences as ‘misguided’ (without further reason) is not only epistemically suspect, it violates the patient’s right to autonomy.7
She observes that suffering can be partly constituted by a person’s values and experiences and that means in order for medicine to be genuinely therapeutic and respectful of non-binary adults, their testimony should be trusted.Gille and Brall turn their attention to the importance of trust for biobanks, and they consider some of Lumann’s points about the importance of institutions acting in ways that enable donors to have confidence that their future interests will be appropriately regarded.8 Their account of trust draws on him when they say:In this article, we understand trust as a relational construct existing between at least two actors where the trusting actor A anticipates that the trusted actor B will, in the future, do or not do what the actor B is trusted for.8
The multiple ways in which tissue samples could be used in the future is a paradigmatic example of the challenges created by trying describe every possible future use and gain consent to these uses. Instead, institutions that hold collections of human tissue should demonstrate themselves to be worthy of their donors’ trust. Gille and Brall suggest: “The biobank as a research institution needs to communicate that appropriate governance frameworks including oversight and accountability mechanisms are in place.”8
Some jurisdictions have introduced legislation that requires healthcare institutions to act in ways that enable patients to know that they will be informed in a full and open manner when things go wrong and they are at risk of harm. Inkster and Cuddihy discuss how the “duty of candour” can be managed based on their experiences of an infection control incident at a children’s hospital.9 This demonstrates how the way in which an institution communicates is important, in addition to the fact of them being open. So being ‘trust-worthy’ requires more of an institution than simply being open about error.The JME welcomes further debate and scholarship on trust and what that means within a healthcare setting. Paying attention to these structural considerations and the values guiding institutions, moves scholarship in medical ethics beyond the microcosm of clinical ethics.Not applicable.This study does not involve human participants.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:51,2023-11-06 14:09:51,153–153,,9DYKUA9H,0.0318471337579617,0.75,0.0352689461045587

For situations where a detention under mental health legislation is required to keep an individual safe, psychiatrists may consider whether to conduct an assessment in person or using video technology. The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not stipulate that an assessment has to be conducted in person. Yet, the Code of Practice envisions that detention assessments would be conducted face to face in all circumstances. During the pandemic, the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland, a statutory body with a duty to promote best practice of the Act, has been asked whether it may be acceptable and indeed preferable for some assessments to be conducted via video technology. Where an assessment is needed to determine if a patient needs to be detained, and where there is a need for social distancing or the need for ‘shielding’, remote assessments may in some circumstances be preferable. In this article, we outline the modification of the Mental Welfare Commission’s previous outright rejection of virtual assessments as the pandemic progressed and discuss the ethical and legal issues the possibility of remote assessments has exposed. We also discuss the limits and when a virtual assessment is not considered ethical.

Besides, they perceived that (2) service users’ trust in public health nurses was a strong expression of professional dignity, and it could be uncovered when recipients of care utilised their services. In addition, public health nurses experienced that (3) professional dignity was an expression of different intertwined interprofessional and social factors.                                         Discussion and conclusion               Professional dignity is simultaneously an essential prerequisite and an outcome of public health nurses’ work. In future, more information would be needed to implement strategies in primary health care to foster nurses’ professional dignity also in international public health arenas.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:50,2023-11-06 14:09:50,1503–1517,,ZI4PW52C,0.032626427406199,0.1,0.0346731485045541

Responsible clinical research drives the advancement of healthcare. Despite tremendous improvements in the globalresearch and development environment since the 1950s, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are often left behind. There are several reasons for this.

Secondly, many people living in low-resource settings distrust research because some past studies have not benefited the participants or the communities involved.Objectives. To present the consensus recommendations by a Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Working Group on how to advance good-quality, ethical clinical research in resource-limited settings.Methods.

At least three COVID‐19 vaccines have been approved or are about to be approved for distribution in many countries. However, with very limited initial availability, only a minority of the population will be able to receive vaccines this winter. Urgent decisions will have to be made about who should receive priority for access. Current policy in the UK appears to take the view that those who are most vulnerable to COVID‐19 should get the vaccine first. While this is intuitively attractive, we argue that there are other possible values and criteria that need to be considered. These include both intrinsic and instrumental values. The former are numbers of lives saved, years of life saved, quality of the lives saved, quality‐adjusted life‐years (QALYs), and possibly others including age. Instrumental values include protecting healthcare systems and other broader societal interests, which might require prioritizing key worker status and having dependants. The challenge from an ethical point of view is to strike the right balance among these values. It also depends on effectiveness of different vaccines on different population groups and on modelling around cost‐effectiveness of different strategies. It is a mistake to simply assume that prioritizing the most vulnerable is the best strategy.

In order to assess and better understand the positive as well as negative outcomes of AI-based AgeTech, a critical analysis of ethical design, digital equity, and policy pathways is required. A crucial question is how AI-based AgeTech may drive practical, equitable, and inclusive multilevel solutions to support healthy, active ageing.             In our paper, we aim to show that a focus on equity is key for AI-based AgeTech if it is to realize its full potential. We propose that equity should not just be an extra benefit or minimum requirement, but the explicit aim of designing AI-based health tech. This means that social determinants that affect the use of or access to these technologies have to be addressed. We will explore how complexity management as a crucial element of AI-based AgeTech may potentially create and exacerbate social inequities by marginalising or ignoring social determinants.

Medication shortages have resulted in lost lives, medication errors, and substantial financial cost. Economic drivers are the primary cause for drug shortages, exacerbated by manufacturing and quality problems, and unreliable and uncertain sources for many raw materials required to synthesize these drugs. Drug shortages force clinicians to make untenable choices and decide which of their patients should receive a lifesaving scarce medication. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many hospitals’ ability to provide basic care and aggravated existing drug shortages. The influx of patients suffering from COVID-19 has exposed flaws in the fractured manner in which essential medications reach patients.

Admission to an epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) is the gold standard for such monitoring in major medical facilities worldwide. In many countries, access can be challenged by limited resources compared to need. Today, triaging admission to such units is generally approached by unwritten protocols that vary by institution. In the absence of explicit guidance, decisions can be ethically taxing and are easy to challenge. In an effort to address this gap, we propose a two-component approach to EMU triage that takes into account the unique landscape of epilepsy monitoring informed by triage literature from other areas of medicine. Through the strategic component, we focus on the EMU wait list management infrastructure at the institutional level. Through the principled component, we apply a combination of the ethical principles of prioritarianism, utilitarianism and justice to triage; and we use individual case examples to illustrate how they apply. The effective implementation of this approach to specific epilepsy centres will need to be customised to the nuances of different settings, including diverse practice patterns, patient populations and constraints on resource distribution, but the conceptual consolidation of its components can alleviate some of the pressures imposed by the complex decisions involved in EMU triage.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:25,2023-11-06 14:10:25,81–86,,HE3PHN5U,0.0186915887850467,0.2307692307692307,0.0313650143073056

Both aspects are falling behind, especially in quantitative social research. From a methodological point of view, quantitative forms of covert observation involve a great distance between the researcher and the research subjects. When human observers are involved, the focus is usually on the reliable application of the measuring instrument. Therefore, herein, a quantitative study is used as an example to show how the protection needs of both the observed persons and the observers can be met in practice. The study involved 40 student observers who covertly captured everyday conversations in real-world settings (e.g. in cafés or trains) by a highly standardised observation scheme. The study suggests that the anonymity of the research subjects and their trust in the observers are crucial for their subsequent consent. However, many participants showed only little or even no interest in the written information they were provided. Further, this study strongly emphasises how mentally stressful covert observations are to the observers. Almost all observers were worried in advance that the people they were observing would prematurely blow their cover and confront them.

Previous scholarship in bioethics and science and technology studies has made clear that different nations have varying expectations about trust, transparency, and public reason in relation to emerging technologies and their governance. The key aims of this article are to assess genetic literacy, perceptions of genetic testing, privacy concerns, and governing norms amongst the Singapore population by collecting surveys.                                         Methods               This study investigated genetic literacy and broad public attitudes toward genetic tests in Singapore with an online public survey (n = 560). To assess potential changes in attitudes following receipt of results from a genetic test, we also surveyed undergraduate students who underwent a genetic screen as part of a university class before and after they received their test results (n = 25).

In natural language processing (NLP), this tendency is reflected in the emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3. These powerful neural network-based models can be used for a range of NLP tasks and their language generation capacities have become so sophisticated that it can be very difficult to distinguish their outputs from human language. LLMs have raised concerns over their demonstrable biases, heavy environmental footprints, and future social ramifications. In December 2020, critical research on LLMs led Google to fire Timnit Gebru, co-lead of the company’s AI Ethics team, which sparked a major public controversy around LLMs and the growing corporate influence over AI research. This article explores the role LLMs play in the political economy of AI as infrastructural components for AI research and development. Retracing the technical developments that have led to the emergence of LLMs, we point out how they are intertwined with the business model of big tech companies and further shift power relations in their favour. This becomes visible through the Transformer, which is the underlying architecture of most LLMs today and started the race for ever bigger models when it was introduced by Google in 2017.

We conclude that regulation should shift from aiming to ensure autonomous consent towards ensuring that users face options that they will use to advance individual and common interests.,,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:49,2023-11-06 14:09:49,93–108,,FP6J9EHM,0.021505376344086,0.1,0.0302270011947431

This article aims to provide a deeper understanding of women’s and health care personnel’s (HCP) experiences with ultrasound viewing during abortion preparation in the first trimester. Qualitative in-depth interviews with women who had been prepared for early abortion and focus group interviews with HCP from gynaecological units were carried out. A hermeneutic-phenomenological analysis, inspired by van Manen, was chosen. Thirteen women who were pregnant and considering abortion in their first trimester and 20 HCP, namely, 19 registered nurses and one medical doctor, were recruited from gynaecological units at six hospitals. The study was approved by the ethics committee (2014/1276). The essential meaning structure of ‘autonomy under pressure’ consisted of two themes that expressed the different experiences of both the women and the HCP, namely, expectations versus precautions and choice versus protection. The women and HCP expressed different attitudes before the consultation that affected their experiences of the ultrasound examination. While the women had expectations of a clarification based on their choice to either see or not see the ultrasound image, HCP seemed to be more concerned with predetermined rules that they believed would protect the women. Consequently, the basis for dialogue was not optimal, and women’s autonomy was under pressure. Health care personnel are ethically challenged during preabortion ultrasound examinations. Meeting the individual woman’s needs and respecting her autonomy during preparation for abortion requires sensitivity, involvement, and dialogue skills by health personnel. According to the woman’s desire to be informed about the possibility of viewing the image during the abortion preparations, a dialogue that is focused in this direction should arise before the examination.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:48,2023-11-06 14:09:48,511–522,,7W2D7NRL,0.0177304964539007,0.3,0.0300387596899224

Understanding the epistemic abilities and limitations of such systems is essential if we are to integrate AI into the decision making processes in a way that takes into account its applicability boundaries. This will help to mitigate potential harm due to misjudgments and, as a result, to raise the trust—understood here as a belief in reliability of—in the AI system. We aim at a minimal requirement for AI meta-explanation which should distinguish machine epistemic processes from similar processes in human epistemology in order to avoid confusion and error in judgment and application.

Nevertheless, healthcare professionals could also identify essential elements to maintain or change in the future, as moral distress and moral challenges can indicate opportunities to strengthen moral resilience of healthcare professionals and organisations.               This study describes 1) the experienced moral distress, challenges and ethical climate concerning end-of-life care of Intensive Care Unit staff during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and 2) their positive experiences and lessons learned, which function as directions for future forms of ethics support.                                         Methods               A cross-sectional survey combining quantitative and qualitative elements was sent to all healthcare professionals who worked at the Intensive Care Unit of the Amsterdam UMC - Location AMC during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of 36 items about moral distress (concerning quality of care and emotional stress), team cooperation, ethical climate and (ways of dealing with) end-of-life decisions, and two open questions about positive experiences and suggestions for work improvement.                                         Results               All 178 respondents (response rate: 25–32%) showed signs of moral distress, and experienced moral dilemmas in end-of-life decisions, whereas they experienced a relatively positive ethical climate. Nurses scored significantly higher than physicians on most items. Positive experiences were mostly related to ‘team cooperation’, ‘team solidarity’ and ‘work ethic’. Lessons learned were mostly related to ‘quality of care’ and ‘professional qualities’.                                         Conclusions               Despite the crisis, positive experiences related to ethical climate, team members and overall work ethic were reported by Intensive Care Unit staff and quality and organisation of care lessons were learned. Ethics support services can be tailored to reflect on morally challenging situations, restore moral resilience, create space for self-care and strengthen team spirit. This can improve healthcare professionals’ dealing of inherent moral challenges and moral distress in order to strengthen both individual and organisational moral resilience.

Besides, similar problems could be raised by, for instance, traumatized migrants with acute needs for healthcare services for other serious conditions. The paper identifies the issues and some positions on them. Arguments for and against these positions are explored. This particular set of problems in healthcare ethics creates several challenges, at both national and international levels, concerning access to transplantation, public willingness to donate organs, optimal use of organs, justice and fairness, and potential conflicts of law, politics and ethics, as well as issues revolving around interaction and communication (or lack of it) between agencies and professions.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:12,2023-11-06 14:05:12,297–311,,N8BGRNWT,0.0314465408805031,0.0,0.02968865971327

While the use of scoring models as tools for prioritization is widespread, they are barely discussed in the medical‐ethical discourse in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic. During this time, the challenge of providing care for patients in need has promoted consequentialist reasoning. In this light, we advocate for the integration of time‐ and context‐sensitive scoring (TCsS) models in prioritization policies that foster treatment opportunities for patients with subacute and chronic conditions. We argue,               first               , that TCsSs enable a more efficient use of resources, reducing avoidable harm to patients by preventing arbitrary postponement of necessary but nonurgent interventions.               Second               , we contend that on an interrelational level, TCsSs render decision‐making pathways more transparent, which promotes the information requirement of patient autonomy and raises confidence in the resulting prioritization decision.               Third               , we claim that TCsS contributes to distributive justice by reallocating available resources to the benefit of elective patients. We conclude that TCsSs promote anticipatory measures that extend the timeframe for responsible action into the future.

Hence, there are ethical challenges for healthcare professionals in establishing a trustful relationship to determine the patient’s preferences and then decide and act based on these preferences. With this comes further challenges regarding how the patient’s autonomy can be protected and promoted.                                         Aim               To describe nurses’ experiences of dealing with older patients’ autonomy when cared for in emergency departments (EDs).

Participants and research context               A total of 13 open-ended interviews were performed with nurses working at two EDs in Sweden.                                         Ethical considerations               The study was reviewed by the Ethical Advisory Board in South East Sweden and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.

Findings               Nurses’ experiences of dealing with older patients’ autonomy in EDs are characterized by moving in a conflicting uphill struggle, indicating obscure thoughts on how patient autonomy can be protected in an ethically challenging context. The phenomenon is further described with its meaning constituents: ‘Being hampered by prioritization under stress’, ‘Balancing paternalism and patient autonomy’, ‘Making decisions without consent in the patient’s best interests’ and ‘Being trapped by notions of legitimate care needs’.                                         Conclusion               Stressful work conditions and lacking organizational strategies in EDs contribute to nurses maintaining unjustified paternalistic care, regardless of the patient’s ability and medical condition, and questioning who has legitimacy for participating in decisions about care. The nurses’ protection and promotion of older patients’ autonomy is dependent on the opportunity, ability and willingness to create a patient relationship where the patient’s voice and preferences are valued as important. Consequently, strategies are needed to improve patient autonomy in EDs based on the idea of ‘relational autonomy’.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:51,2023-11-06 14:09:51,1266–1279,,KHUMG2K2,0.026771653543307,0.1111111111111111,0.0289247150847268

The catalogue of schemes in Walton, Reed and Macagno’s 2008 book, Argumentation Schemes, served as our starting point for analysis of the naturally occurring arguments in written text, i.e., text in different genres having different types of author, audience, and subject domain (genetics, international relations, environmental science policy, AI ethics), for different argument goals, and for different possible future applications. We would often first attempt to analyze the arguments in our corpora in terms of those schemes, then adapt schemes as needed for the goals of the project, and in some cases implement them for use in computational models. Among computational researchers, the main interest in argumentation schemes has been for use in argument mining by applying machine learning methods to existing argument corpora. In contrast, a primary goal of our research has been to learn more about written arguments themselves in various contemporary fields. Our approach has been to manually analyze semantics, discourse structure, argumentation, and rhetoric in texts. Another goal has been to create sharable digital corpora containing the results of our studies. Our approach has been to define argument schemes for use by human corpus annotators or for use in logic programs for argument mining.

While their health systems differ, countries such as New Zealand, the USA and the UK at least partially rely on international medical graduates (IMGs) to ensure access to health services, particularly in underserved communities. This paper focuses on the challenges faced by many IMGs, particularly those that constrain their capacity to live and work in the countries that rely on their skills. These challenges give rise to two ethical problems. First, they represent a failure of reciprocity towards IMGs; second, they represent a source of harm, both to IMGs themselves and to communities whose healthcare service depends on contributions made by IMGs.

Much recent literature examines the ethical consequences of employing ML within medical and psychiatric practice but the potential impact on psychiatric diagnostic systems has so far not been well-developed. In this article, we aim to explore the challenges that arise from the recent use of ANNs for the old problems of psychiatric nosology. To enable an empirically supported critical reflection on the topic, we conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with Swiss and German experts in computational psychiatry. Here, we report our findings structured around two themes, namely (1) the possibility of using ML for defining or refining of psychiatric classification, and (2) the desirability of employing ML for psychiatric nosology. We discuss these themes by relating them to recent debates about network theory for psychiatric nosology and show why empirical research in the field should critically reflect on its contribution to psychopathology research. In sum, we argue that beyond technical, regulatory, and ethical challenges, philosophical reflection is crucial to harness the potential of ML in psychiatry.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:28,2023-11-06 14:10:28,,,FSYQIDAZ,0.0298507462686567,0.0,0.0274443903069595

However, in the heightened stress of emergency situations, interaction between nurses and relatives can raise ethical challenges.                                         Research objectives               The present analysis aimed at elaborating a typology of nurses’ experience of ethical support and challenges in their interaction with relatives in emergency situations.                                         Research design               Thirty-three semi-structured interviews and six focus groups were conducted with nurses from different nursing homes in Germany. Data were analysed according to Mayring’s method of qualitative content analysis.                                         Participants and research context               Participants were licensed nurses working in nursing homes.                                         Ethical considerations               Ethical approval was granted by Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences (02.07.2020) and the Ethics Committee of Hannover Medical School (Nr. 8866_BO_K_2020; 27.01.2020). Interviewees were anonymised and focus group were pseudonymised during transcription. All participants provided written consent.                                         Findings/results               In emergency situations, relatives can represent important sources of support for nurses. However, they may also give rise to different challenges, relating to four ethical conflicts: (1) the challenge of meeting the information needs of relatives while providing appropriate care to all residents; (2) the challenge of managing relatives’ demands for hospitalisation when hospitalisation is not deemed necessary by nurses; (3) the challenge of managing relatives’ demands for lifesaving treatment when such treatment contradicts the will of the resident; and (4) the challenge of attempting to initiate hospitalisation when relatives oppose this course of action. Several external factors make these conflicts especially challenging for nurses: fear of legal consequences, a low staffing ratio, and a lack of qualified nursing staff.                                         Conclusions               Conflict between nurses and relatives typically revolves around hospitalisation and the initiation of lifesaving treatment.

Nevertheless, the complexity of processes and physical phenomena, time as well as economic constraints and not least further endeavours as well as achievements in medicine and healthcare continuously raise the need to evaluate and to improve clinical decision-making. This article scrutinises if and how clinical decision-making processes are challenged by the rise of so-called artificial intelligence-driven decision support systems (AI-DSS). In a first step, this article analyses how the rise of AI-DSS will affect and transform the modes of interaction between different agents in the clinic. In a second step, we point out how these changing modes of interaction also imply shifts in the conditions of trustworthiness, epistemic challenges regarding transparency, the underlying normative concepts of agency and its embedding into concrete contexts of deployment and, finally, the consequences for (possible) ascriptions of responsibility.

This article examines the novel implications of emergent behavior of autonomous AI systems designed for conflict through two case studies. These case studies include (1) a swarm system designed for maritime intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations, and (2) a next-generation humanitarian notification system. Both case studies represent current or near-future technology in which emergent behavior is possible, demonstrating that such behavior can be both unpredictable and more reliable depending on the level at which the system is considered.

How then, if at all, can we make use of crucial emerging technologies? According to Colin Allen and Wendell Wallach, the advent of so-called ‘artificial moral agents’ (AMAs) is inevitable. Still, this notion may seem to push back the problem, leaving those who have an interest in developing autonomous technology with a dilemma. We may need to scale-back our efforts at deploying AMAs (or at least maintain human oversight); otherwise, we must rapidly and drastically update our moral and legal norms in a way that ensures responsibility for potentially avoidable harms.

Although studies have examined patient perspectives on receiving SF, little research has been conducted examining the experiences of clinicians offering SF to parents of newborns receiving genomic sequencing for a recently diagnosed medical condition.To address this, we conducted qualitative interviews exploring the views and experiences of 12 clinicians who offered SF to parents of infants who had diagnostic exome sequencing (ES) to identify the cause of their hearing loss. Interviews explored clinicians’ accounts of parents’ choices and decision-making about receiving SF, their views on whether and when to offer SF, their experiences returning SF, and any ethical challenges they encountered. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and analyzed using inductive content analysis.Clinicians reported parents who declined all SF often felt finding out about future conditions unrelated to their child’s hearing loss may be unhelpful, or even harmful, or were overwhelmed by their child’s diagnosis. Clinicians also reported that some parents chose SF because they felt obliged to, even if they did not want to receive them. They explained that while some parents experienced decision-making regarding SF as positive, for others, this process was challenging or distressing. While clinicians generally agreed SF should be offered, mainly to promote parental choice, most felt SF should be offered after disclosing diagnostic results, primarily to avoid overwhelming parents. Clinicians encountered several ethical challenges, including balancing parental autonomy with non-maleficence, wanting to report or not report certain SF, and questioning whether parents can make an autonomous choice regarding SF.Our findings, which are novel as they relate to parents of young infants with a recent diagnosis of hearing loss, add new insights into clinicians’ and parents’ decision-making regarding SF in pediatrics.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:27,2023-11-06 14:10:27,74–83,,NS2M4XRW,0.0238907849829351,0.0,0.0224931522234215

These efforts meant that the journal published a number of high quality articles analysing these issues and it has shaped subsequent discussions and debate in exactly the way that we strive for. Ultimately, outcomes such as impact, readership and contributing to knowledge are what matters most for a journal, but the imperfect metrics that journal performance is measured against matter too. So, the editors of the JME would also like to thank our authors, reviewers and readers for helping the JME score 5.9 in the most recent Clarivate Impact Factor (IF) rating. While that is not the highest IF in bioethics, it is worth mentioning that the highest citing paper from the bioethics journal with the highest IF, would have rated as the seventh most cited paper in the JME during this period. So, this latest rating reveals that the JME has had a very significant impact, readership and contribution to knowledge during the pandemic and we want to thank those who made this happen.The ethical challenges of the pandemic have been a catalyst for exploring normative theories and concepts that make sense of and justify ethical positions about our pandemic response. At the same time, those communicating about what others should do during the pandemic have sought strategies for reaching people and distilling evidence based policy decisions. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was quick to adopt simple and effective advice. In March 2020 she saidI have one final message. Be kind. I know people will want to act as enforcers. And I understand that, people are afraid and anxious. We will play that role for you. What we need from you, is to support one another. Go home tonight and check in on your neighbours. Start a phone tree with your street. Plan how you’ll keep in touch with one another. We will get through this together, but only if we stick together. Be strong and be kind.1
Despite Ardern’s appeal to citizens to support each other and leave any needed enforcement of lockdown restrictions to authorities, some people were enthusiastic about reporting lockdown transgressions, as was the case in most places.2 Nonetheless, the simple imperative to ‘be kind’ was effective at a time of crisis and was adopted elsewhere.If a similar suggestion had been made in an ethics journal perhaps it might have been justified by an appeal to a principle such as solidarity, or a virtues based approach, an account of justice, or even as a way to maximize total utility. The simple imperative to ‘be kind’ makes sense on most ethical approaches and was effective simply on its own terms. Of course there are a number of ways of ethically justifying policy settings during the pandemic and in this issue of the JME, Stephen John and Emma Curran explore a contractualist justification for pandemic lockdowns.3
Whereas we might expect ‘reasonableness’ to be something that follows from a disposition to ‘be kind’, for a contractualist it is a method whereby we can test the permissibility of a course of action by asking whether it could reasonably be rejected by others who are impacted by that course of action.4 For example, there has been debate in the JME about selective lockdowns and whether it is permissible to have age targeted lockdowns so as to reflect the fact that some age groups are more at risk from COVID-19 than younger age groups.5 Rather than weighing costs and benefits, a contractualist might ask whether selective lockdowns could reasonably be rejected by groups impacted by that course of action. As John and Curran observe ‘…decisions about lockdown involve difficult judgments about the relative value of central human goods. Even worse, the expected costs and benefits of lockdown policies are spread unequally.’The pandemic has highlighted and amplified health inequities in many countries and the normative tools medical ethics brings to bear on these issues should be up to the task.6 7 John and Curran claim that utility maximising approaches such as cost benefit analysis (CBA) have been found wanting during the pandemic, they say:First, concerns about distributive justice seem central to debates both about COVID-19 in general, which has strikingly unequal patterns of morbidity and mortality, and, as noted, to lockdown specifically. A focus on aggregate outcomes is blind to these worries…CBAs… seem ill suited to capturing worries about structural and relational inequalities—say, stemming from race or class—expressed in the pandemic context.John and Curran show how a contractualist emphasis upon the relative plausibility of objections to proposed lockdown measures captures issues that risk being lost if we opt for a CBA approach.…although contractualism is focused on the complaints that generic individuals can make against principles, grounded on their own interests, the approach is well suited to tackle the kinds of worries about inequalities in risk of disease and inequalities in the effects of lockdown… In focusing our attention on those at the highest risk of ill health, our approach automatically places our attention on the most vulnerable members of society, and their claims against others.It is important to be kind, but it is also important for medical ethics to draw on the best conceptual tools at our disposal. That’s particularly so when facing a set of new issues that bring into relief problems that our default approaches might neglect.Not applicable.Not applicable.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:50,2023-11-06 14:09:50,577–578,,37VKC7IB,0.022050716648291,0.0,0.0218485591613885

Financial barriers, hospital costs, reimbursement rates, health insurance policies and deductibles, out-of-network hospitals, socioeconomic factors, and the COVID-19 pandemic are prominent contributing factors.

By providing ethically responsible and professionally competent care, they have the opportunity to influence what can alleviate and reduce suffering and promote health in a longer perspective.

Thinking about the march of progress in digital and virtual technologies to treat mental health and brain disorders has brought me back to research and reading I started over a decade ago now—on Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), on authenticity, on moral self-understanding. I am finding texts outside bioethics more useful again, specifically classic writing in the philosophy and sociology of science. I had set most of these texts aside some years ago, finding them irritatingly obscure and, in that inaccessibility, also clubby and elitist. Perhaps it is a rite of passage to return to formative texts after some years of distance. And for me, several years of focus on empirical work seems to have resurrected a thirst for theoretical underpinning.

In research with young girls who were diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD, without the “H” for hyperactivity), I discovered that there was a trend in the interviews to describing an imaginary place of natural sanctuary, fun, joy and creativity. Several of the girls called this place “Lala Land”; it was where they “went” when they had gone “away” during lessons or in other activities that demanded focus on specific tasks. Most of the young girls did not enter and exit Lala Land intentionally, and that was a source of distress for them. But, if they could have control over their entrances and exits (and stimulant medication did afford some girls this level of control), they would want Lala Land to be a part of their daily lives. Paradoxically, with or without medication, Lala Land felt like an empowering place. Girls rejoiced in the ability to make decisions about the architecture of the landscape and the ecosystem of humans, flora and fauna.

It struck me, watching my daughters play the game “Minecraft,” that the designers of this game had rather perfectly captured the desire to be architects of their ecosystem. Amartya Sen (2009) argues that capacity to be an architect of a world, in this way, is meaningless without opportunity, thus his emphasis on “capabilities.” When I read Skorburg and Yam’s (Citation2022) helpful coverage of the lack of evidence for digital mental health interventions, I wonder whether anything might change if, in the case of young people, they themselves were allowed to design the world of the intervention, practise the cognitive and affective skills they are thought to be lacking in settings that offer valued rewards and align with their preferences and priorities.

For example, much has been written about “Autcraft” (https://www.acamh.org/blog/minecraft-young-people-autism/)—the use of Minecraft among young people with autism, which is, to my understanding, created, moderated and governed by people with autism for use by community members. It also encourages peer to peer support and mutual working out of problems in the game, which aligns with a preference many young people have for mental health support from peers over clinicians (Repper and Carter Citation2011). Of course, this approach carries quite a lot of risks as well, having to do with the competencies and capacities of a peer to provide mental health support to a child with significant needs. But it seems to me that the digital world offers an opportunity at least to try carefully designed and properly safeguarded approaches that democratize “expertise” in mental health support (Singh et al. Citation2020) One example in the UK is the on-line message board Childline, created by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (https://www.nspcc.org.uk/keeping-children-safe/our-services/childline/). Childline offers anonymous young users a place to post and to support others who post, with transparent rules and light touch moderation by adults to ensure that appropriate referral to services is made if needed. Thousands of children use Childline message boards and find the peer support helpful both practically and in the context of their mental health.

I also admit to finding the potential for technologies such as VR and XR exciting, in so far as there is further opportunity to allow young people to practice moral, behavioral and cognitive capacities in purpose-built worlds that they design. We wrote about the potential for bioethics research (which we call “design bioethics”) using purpose-built engineered tools (Pavarini et al. Citation2021), and here there is a further potential that such tools can also be used as interventions that empower young people and promote their mental health and wellbeing. The potential risks in specific groups, such as incarcerated patients, are important to identify and consider, as Ligthart et al. note (Citation2022), for reasons of history, of ethics, and the persistence of deep social inequalities. At the same time, it is important not to use the label of “vulnerability” as a way of too quickly discounting the potential for individuals to make informed and positive decisions to utilize technologies in ways that enable them to live a good life. The human rights perspective taken by Ligthart et al is valuable because it frames vulnerability through the lens of human dignity and respect for autonomy and therefore requires careful consideration of the barriers that the label “vulnerable” can erect (Palk et al. Citation2020).

The issue of vulnerability in children is often raised in the context of child and adolescent mental health interventions. I wonder: does a child in Lala Land have this thing called “cognitive liberty” in so far as it is understood to be a mind or brain free of technological interference that would change emergent thoughts, feelings, behaviors. One answer might be “no”—not if the child”s cognitive capacities without medication mean that she is unable to exercise the sort of cognitive control that she would find valuable—such as, for example, the ability to enter and exit Lala Land intentionally. Is medication an analytic equivalent to an XR headset?

This line of thought returns me to an old chestnut: what is the difference between education, which is designed to intervene on children’s cognitive, behavioral and emotional capacities and futures, and the various technologies we use to intervene on these capacities in medicine and psychology. We used to say that those technologies that bypass the control of the human agent—such as deep brain stimulation—were the ones to worry about most. Leaving aside the question of whether such technologies are an exceptional case, I have come to think that we need a more complex theorization of the human-technology relationship on which to hang our ethics, if ethics is to stay relevant. This is where my reading in the philosophy and sociology of science returns to me.

Scholars like Donna Haraway have long argued that we should re-frame the relationship between humans and technology, as in the challenging “Cyborg Manifesto” (Haraway Citation1985). The sociologist Alan Prout (Citation2004) argues that children should be seen as akin to techno-humans From these perspectives, the important ethical analysis is not what technology is “doing to” an apparently autonomous human mind or brain. Rather, we should start with an assumption of a “hybrid of machine and organism,” and ethical analysis should focus on the conditions—individual, social and structural—that give rise to an ability to be a moral agent and to treated as having moral worth. According to Judith Butler (Citation2005), this ethical analysis must grapple with (what she views as) the fact that we are not free in the way that presumptions about “cognitive liberty” suggest. Butler writes:

[N]o “I” belongs to itself. From the outset, it comes into being through an address I can neither recall nor recuperate, and when I act, I act in a world whose structure is in large part not of my making—which is not to say that there is no making and no acting that is mine. There surely is. It means only that the “I,” its suffering and acting, telling and showing, take place within a crucible of social relations… [a]nd when we do act and speak, we not only disclose ourselves but act on the schemes of intelligibility that govern who will be a speaking being, subjecting them to rupture or revision, consolidating their norms, or contesting their hegemony. (Butler Citation2005, 132)

Perhaps this provocation, which has taken me years to begin to understand, helps to advance our field’s thinking about a neuroethics for cyborgs, which started over two decades ago (Wolpe, Citation2004). A key challenge, it seems to me, is how to retain the important emphasis on the “integrity” of the individual while also tackling its limitations. The assumption of the brain, or indeed the mind, as a fixed and isolated entity, with a self arising as an independent emergent construct, is not well aligned with the connectedness that is inherent in ‘techno-human’ development, or in the embodied multiplicities that interactions across virtual, digital and ‘real’ spaces demand, or in the requirement to make transparent the epistemological and structural limitations that form our being in the world.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:48,2023-11-06 14:09:48,141–143,,IS4DD52V,0.0172771250863856,0.3076923076923077,0.0198830126708495

Legal provisions for SBDs exist in the Netherlands since 2008 and were updated in 2020. While ethicists and legal scholars have identified several benefits and risks of SBDs, few data on stakeholder perspectives on SBDs are available.                                         Aims               The aim of the study was to identify opportunities and challenges of SBDs perceived by stakeholders who have personal or professional experience with legally enforceable SBDs.                                         Methods               Data collection was carried out in the Netherlands from February 2020 to October 2021 by means of semi-structured interviews. Participants were selected through purposive sampling and snowball methods. Interviews were conducted with mental health service users (n = 7), professionals (n = 13), and an expert on SBD policy (n = 1), resulting in a total number of 21 interviews. The data were analyzed thematically.                                         Results               Perceived benefits of SBDs included increased autonomy, improvement of the therapeutic relationship, possibility of early intervention and prevention of harm, prevention of compulsory care, reduction of the duration of compulsory care and recovery, mitigation of negative experiences around compulsory care, and guidance for professionals in providing compulsory care. Perceived risks included infeasibility of SBD instructions, difficulty in decision-making around SBD activation, limited accessibility of SBDs, disappointment of service users due to non-compliance with SBDs, and limited evaluation and updating of SBD content. Barriers to SBD completion included lack of knowledge of SBDs among professionals, lack of motivation or insight among service users, and lack of professional support for SBD completion. Facilitators of SBD completion and activation included support for SBD completion, involvement of relatives and peer experts, specification of SBD content, and evaluation of compulsory care and SBD content. The new legal framework was regarded as having both positive and negative effects on SBD implementation.                                         Conclusions               Stakeholders who have personal or professional experience with legally enforceable SBDs perceive SBDs as having important benefits and tend not to articulate the fundamental ethical concerns about SBDs which can be found in the ethics and legal literature.

379,379,Response to ?the Ethical Challenge of Decolonisation and the Future of New Testament Studies?,Studies in Christian Ethics,36.0,1,10.1177/09539468221137666,"Malcolm, Hannah",2023.0,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09539468221137666,journalArticle,"David Horrell's paper ‘The Ethical Challenge of Decolonisation and the Future of New Testament Studies’ proposes that both the public-facing and internal ethics of New Testament studies require close attention to the ‘who’ and ‘what’ of biblical interpretation—who is doing the interpreting that shapes academic and popular discourse concerning Scripture? And to what end is that interpretation being carried out?
In response, Horrell pushes beyond the now relatively mainstream observation that academic reading lists are homogenous and could be diversified. He proposes that we must provincialise—or ‘weird’—the Western traditions that have trained many of us, and, relatedly, pay close enough attention to our companions in the majority world that we might be equipped to ask again what the discipline itself is for. It is not that the work of making reading lists more diverse is old news, but that the reason for doing so ought not to be simply to add a little variety to a predominantly male, pale and stale, agenda. We could summarise Horrell's framing as follows: genuine decolonisation of biblical scholarship does not welcome presumed outsiders in, but rather helps transform assumptions about the very idea that there is an inside (and thus academically rigorous) track, and an outside which is provocative but not normative.
Horrell goes on to offer an overview of how we might see the provincial nature of contemporary European biblical studies for ourselves: largely concerned with philological and historical-critical approaches to Scripture and related debates concerning authorship, dating, intertextual influence, and so on. While Horrell observes that this tradition has often tended to assume a Christian audience, participants in the tradition rarely make explicit reference to the particular context in which the reading has emerged. A primarily historical-critical approach to Scripture is of course not even representative of the history of European Christian readings of the Bible; it is a relentlessly modern mode. An anecdotal aside comes to mind here: I am training for ordained ministry, and in our ‘Further Biblical Studies’ class we read a range of interpretations of the Parable of the Good Samaritan from a variety of geographic and historical contexts. My fellow classmates were interested in and gently challenged by a couple of ‘non-Western’ or ‘postcolonial’ readings. But they seemed most disturbed by—and ready to outright reject—Augustine's highly allegorical reading. We do not offer a ‘view from nowhere’, and such a reminder is not a rejection of historical-critical approaches, or ‘Western thought’ more generally, but rather a welcome dose of humility in our sweeping application of them.
To help us imagine a decolonised future for biblical interpretation and Christian ethics, Horrell follows his overview of the historical-critical field by introducing An Asian Introduction to the New Testament, drawing out some of the ways this edited volume points to a different approach to both the ethics of biblical interpretation and what we imagine biblical ethics to be. Horrell points out that a key theme of the Introduction is making explicit the connection between the scriptural text and contemporary Asian experiences, finding points of identification for the contemporary reader and the world of the New Testament. This is a good example of a different framing for how we read the ethics of Scripture. Modern historical-critical readings of New Testament ethics—whether they are concerned with wealth, family, war, or the Church's worship—often operate with the assumption of distance from the text and its cultural world, using the historical-critical method to demonstrate how alien the first-century Middle East is to us. Instead, many of the contributors to this collection assume that it is possible to find experiential intimacy with the cultural world of the text and thus hear what it has to say to the contemporary Church. An underlying assumption here is that at least part of the work of interpreting scriptures ought to be theological and ethical, not merely socio-historical analysis. Horrell proposes that the collection, and works like it, offers us this ‘extra step’ to our reading of Scripture; articulating our own context and inviting the text to meet it. It is worth pausing to observe that this step sounds a lot like what many of us call ‘homiletics’—and that one of the parochialisms of contemporary Western academia is to assume that biblical studies and exhorting the Church can be easily separated.
Horrell's paper opens a rich series of reflections for us to probe together in relation to the who and what of biblical interpretation, and what it would look like to genuinely decolonise New Testament studies. In what follows I offer two of my own.
The first reflection is concerned with the cross-pollination of scriptural readings in our hyper-connected world. If I might return to reading the Good Samaritan in theological college for a moment: it was not actually the postcolonial scholars we read which appeared most weird to my classmates, but Augustine's fifth-century allegorical imagination. Are the varieties of contemporary biblical scholarship as ‘weird’ to each other as we might like to think? Or do our global economic Empires still iron out genuinely culturally distinctive readings of Scripture? Honesty about the influences of supposedly ‘Western’ academic norms on ‘non-Western’ scholarship—and vice versa—does not detract from the urgency of decolonisation, but simply prompts us to recognise that the distinctions between approaches in a hyper-connected world are not as wildly different as we might be tempted to imagine. Most of the contributors to An Asian Introduction to the New Testament, for example, did their postgraduate study at a Western university. And, as Horrell points out, many of them still begin with some basic questions which emerge out of historical-critical approaches to text. This does not make their contributions less ‘Asian’, but rather means that we need to abandon a purist imagination which prevents us from seeing the overlaps and blurred lines between supposedly distinct modes of academic enquiry.
One of the more critical questions we might raise about these overlaps is concerned with English as the academic language—can we genuinely talk about decolonising a discipline while the expectation is that participants must be fluent in English? This is both a question of narrowing participation but also of the ways that language shapes thought. The English language carries with it certain provincial assumptions, and these are also absorbed and rehearsed in the process of participating in the discipline in English. This is not an easy problem to solve, but it is a vitally important one.
The second (related) reflection I offer is concerned with the kinds of decolonised interventions into the discipline which we are willing to accept—and whether our decolonised curricula actually reflect the contemporary diversity of approaches to Scripture, or whether they are more likely to reflect those non-Western readings which have been deemed permissible in small doses to a liberal Western mainstream. To give one small example: the twentieth-century Liberation Theology tradition is now a go-to ‘diversity’ intervention in many biblical studies’ reading lists. It has begun to take on a certain level of Western academic respectability, even if still regularly treated with suspicion. But as Singaporean theologian Simon Chan has pointed out, the liberation theological tradition as articulated in academia (or, as he puts it, ‘the intelligentsia’) is not necessarily a reflection of what he calls the ‘grassroots’ of Asian Christian communities, despite it being treated as such by many Western academic institutions.1 If we were looking for some genuinely ‘provincial’ modes of biblical study, Chan and others have proposed—to give one example—that many oppressed Christian communities are far more closely aligned with Pentecostal modes of thought,2 which are still radically underrepresented in the academy.
What kinds of provincial readings of Scripture have we placed outside the frame of our ethical enquiry, and is our reasoning more substantial than simply finding some approaches too alien to our own assumptions that their modes of thought make us uncomfortable? There are of course good reasons to exclude certain approaches to the ethics of Scripture and scriptural ethics. From within my own Western context, the cynicism of hyper-scientistic analysis and prosperity gospel readings come to mind. But discerning our reasons for exclusion and inclusion—and for whose flourishing we have made those decisions—plays a vital role in stripping away some of colonialism's imaginative power.
One of the anxieties I have encountered amongst those who resist decolonising proposals is that in doing so we might also abandon the shared intellectual basis upon which the discipline has operated for the last several hundred years, and thus find ourselves unable to talk meaningfully to each other. But Horrell's paper points us in the direction of a more hopeful future for the discipline. Provincialising our readings of Scripture may help us to see the past and present of the Church more clearly; better anticipating her shared and diverse calling in the world, drawn into closer communion, and knowing whose body she truly is—not ours, but Christ's.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:25,2023-11-06 14:10:25,58–61,Publisher: SAGE Publications,VXW222HN,0.0164271047227926,0.2142857142857142,0.0183476611041047

As applied, it deals poorly with issues of social justice, ageing and end of life issues; cases involving small numbers—such as decisions about orphan drugs—are also contested.Unfortunately, differences in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are presented with a degree of precision which contributes to an ‘illusion of validity’.1 Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen has suggested that ‘when all the requirements of ubiquitous market-centred evaluation have been incorporated into the procedures of cost–benefit analysis, it is not so much a discipline as a daydream’.2
As with any approach to public decision making, the use of economic evaluation rests on an implicit social licence, including that the decision making is fair and reasonable. Many countries have developed special policies for rare, ‘ultrarare’ or ‘orphan’ diseases to moderate the effect of a ubiquitous application of economic evaluation. The threshold for defining ‘small’ or rare is a matter of judgement and ranges between 2 and 80 per 100 000 population.3

Using ethnographic descriptions of personal experience as well as secondary source material, the authors conclude that three possible response behaviours at the farmer-researcher interface are available when it comes to potentially ‘exposing’ one’s dietary identity – to divulge, to dissemble, or to divert, and that each comes with its own ethical and moral challenges. We argue that the research field and the researcher’s personal world are separate, though blurred, realms and, while the collection of quality data is important to any study, behavioural decisions should always be undertaken with boundaries of safety, and emotional and moral comfort in mind.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:28,2023-11-06 14:10:28,1–16,Publisher: Springer Verlag,L6RLRGIX,0.0189573459715639,0.0,0.0175530981218185

This research was conducted to examine the self-transcendence of the leading fighters, intensive care nurses, during the Covid 19 pandemic.                                         Methods               The descriptive phenomenological research method was used in the study. The research was carried out between June and December 2020 with the nurses who care for Covid 19 patients in the Covid 19 intensive care service in different provinces of Turkey. The research was completed with 25 participants. A semi-structured interview form prepared based on the Theory of Self-Transcendence (vulnerability, self-transcendence, and well-being) and based on the literature was used to collect data.

However, it also has presented ethical challenges. An emerging challenge is how to understand the nature and extent of investigators’ obligations to patient-subjects. Prior scholarship on investigator duties has generally been grounded upon the premise that research and clinical care are distinct activities, bearing distinct duties. Yet this premise—and its corresponding implications—are challenged when research and clinical care are deliberately integrated. After presenting three case studies from recent pragmatic clinical trials, we identify six differences between explanatory trials and embedded research that limit the application of existing scholarship for ascertaining investigator duties. We suggest that these limitations indicate a need to account for the implications of usual care and to move beyond a narrow focus on the investigator-subject dyad, one that better reflects the team- and institution-based nature of contemporary health systems.",,2022.0,2023-11-06 14:09:49,2023-11-06 14:09:49,10–21,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,DB2GZP3Z,0.01875,0.0,0.0172739672642244

Its thesis is that in at least some contexts of evaluation a central part of some persons’ well-being consists in their satisfying certain “personal needs”. Unlike common conceptions of other non-instrumental needs, which make those out to be moralised, universal, and minimal, personal needs are expansive and particular to particular persons, generated rather by persons’ non-moral personal commitments. Against objections to the contrary, I show how these are genuine necessities, since unlike mere desires and freely escapable aims, personal needs constitute objective, inescapable, and non-compensable practical requirements. The personal-need-satisfaction theory of well-being combines objectivity with subject-dependence in novel ways, and motivates well-being pluralism at the level of individual agency.

Warren: Her Work in the Making of Ecofeminism,Ethics and the Environment,28.0,1,10.2979/een.2023.a899187,"Glazebrook, Tricia",2023.0,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/899187,journalArticle,"  Karen J. Warren was born on Long Island, New York, on September 10, 1947. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Minnesota in 1970, and a Master's degree (1974) and Doctorate (1978) from the University of Massachusetts—Amherst. Her dissertation was one of the first on environmental ethics. In the early years of her career, she taught at St. Olaf College in Northfield Minnesota, until 1985 when she joined the Philosophy department at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. In 1995, she was the second Ecofeminist Scholar-in-Residence at Murdoch University in Australia. In 2002, she was a Round Table Scholar at Oxford University. In 2004, she held the Women's Chair in Humanistic Studies at Marquette.  Throughout these achievements, Warren was a dynamic thinker committed to 'real world' issues and strongly committed to public engagement. She took philosophy to be a democratic practice and was committed to the social impacts of philosophy. In her outreach, she taught prison inmates and developed award-winning environmental curricula for schoolchildren, for which she received awards. She was an international scholar who faced issues in peace studies, feminism, and environmental ethics, and is known for bringing those areas of research together. In feminism, her Unconventional History of Philosophy: Conversations Between Men and Women Philosophers (2009), a fifteen-chapter book that pairs female and male philosophers throughout the centuries, is a fascinating book that breaks down the gender bias in philosophy that has rarely recognized women's contributions to the discipline, and seems to be continuing that practice. She is most known for her work as an ecofeminist, that is the focal topic of this paper. [End Page 1]  The first time I met Karen was in 1995 when I invited her to Colgate University in upstate New York to celebrate its twenty-fifth year since it began accepting female students. She changed everything—epistemology, ontology, ethics … I learned from her what, beyond contemporary science-based definitions of knowledge, is another kind of knowing from generations of experience built in long-standing cultures. For quite some time, ethics was not considered in philosophy really to be philosophy that, like science, was expected to be grounded on logic. Contemporary 'science,' a generalization that actually covers a wide range of disciplines—e.g., biology, physics, actuarial science, computer science, etc.—is logical in so far as it is more or less based on quantitative assessment using numerical data and mathematics. Ethics, that is inherently qualitative, is not taken to carry the neutrality of mathematics and science. Warren rejected that view and instead, as I will show in more detail below, argued for a different logic based on care. She also argued that understanding what knowledge is is unique to culture, and on this basis, she has advocated for listening to indigenous voices and voices in the global South that are outside Eurocentric knowledge systems despite the impacts of colonialism. Before taking on these issues, however, Warren's role in ecofeminism, that emerged during her higher education in philosophy, and her development in consequence of her ecofeminist thinking, must first be addressed.  Practically speaking, the crucially impactful thing that Warren did for ecofeminism was to sustain it. In the 1970s, ecofeminism was emerging with a vision of women's power that was challenged by the women's connection to nature as her reproductive capacity, hence re-awakening an essentialist inscription of biologism for women that once again implied mothers' natural confinement to domesticity. Ecofeminists responded to this challenge. Ortner (1974) argued that women are not closer to nature than men, just constructed to appear so, thereby making change possible only if achieved in both cultural assumptions and social institutions. Amongst such debates, new medical technologies were appropriating the birthing process. Ecofeminist writers, such as Mary Daly in Gyn/Ecology (Daly 1978) and Susan Griffin in Woman and Nature: The Roaring Inside Her (Griffin 1978), both published in 1978, wanted to take that power back from patriarchy through the ""Great Goddess"" as a ""symbol of life and death powers and waxing and waning energies in the universe and in...

We applied a qualitative research design with a phenomenological hermeneutic approach using open individual interviews. A total of 15 registered nurses employed in pulmonary and oncology wards of three university hospitals and home care in one municipality were recruited. Four themes emerged from the analysis: (1) unprepared for the request; (2) meeting direct, indirect, and nonverbal requests; (3) working in a gray zone, and (4) feeling alone and powerless. The study found that nurses were unsure how to handle such requests due to professional uncertainty about assisted dying. Working in an environment where the topic is taboo made nurses morally uncertain, and some perceived this as moral distress.

S.",2023.0,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15265161.2023.2217128,journalArticle,"Pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs) seek to show the effectiveness of treatments in routine, clinical practice (MacPherson 2004). However, a number of ethical challenges come to the fore when collateral findings (CFS) discoveries that may have implications for patients' health but have not been produced to address the primary research questions of a trial (Weinfurt et al. 2022) occur during PCTs. Although the social and scientific value of CFs may be demon- strated in patients, clinicians, and the healthcare sys- tem (Morain et al. 2020), investigators still struggle with how to deal with such findings. Morain and Largent (2023) argue for shifts away from traditional approaches such as changes in the investigator-subject dyads. Central to that paradigm shift, this commen- tary argues, is a novel reconceptualization of PCTs. In this vein, we develop a nuanced neuroethical lens that can help balance the interests of some of the key play ers in CF-associated PCTs.
PCTS offer specific benefits such as eliciting evi- dence that may shape real-world healthcare decisions and contribute to improving research efficiency (Morain et al. 2021) by incorporating research into clinical care in healthcare settings. Although the CFs associated with PCTs may be discovered intentionally or unintentionally (Weinfurt et al. 2022), researchers who engage in PCTs (regardless of their distance from the bedside) cannot feign ""complete ignorance"" of the potential for CFs, their implications, and outcomes. This is because their decision to embed a PCT into clinical care, ab initio, and the execution of the actual trial causally bring about the attendant possible out- comes of the PCTs in relation to the study results and the attendant CFs. Specifically, a PCT may generate (1) no CFs, (2) CFs of clinical significance, (3) CFs of
no clinical significance, and (4) CFs of uncertain clin- ical significance. In other words, whether or not a CF will ensue and its clinical and attendant ethical signifi- cance will vary across individual PCTs. Therefore, the specific nature of these clinical and ethical parameters will ultimately determine the right course of action during specific PCTs.
Implied in the preceding analysis is the difficulty in adopting a one-size-fits-all outlook on PCT-CFs. To be sure, the kinds of questions that embedded clinical research seeks to answer in real-world settings demand a new kind of understanding (Morain and Largent 2023). Re-conceptualizing PCTs through a neuroethical lens may be valuable in this regard. At the level of description, this entails seeing the collat- eral findings that characterize PCTs as analogically mirroring the newer scientific information that trigger the decisional shifts (e.g., design flaws and production defects) of products recall (Berman 1999). This makes sense considering the fact that decisions in real life settings are often made in a manner that allows newer information to inform decisional alterations, largely because knowledge often evolves in an inevitably evolving reality (Afolabi and Kelly 2022). Therefore, in a manner similar to how products are recalled when hitherto unavailable information become avail- able and are adjudged to be valuable (e.g., preventing health risks), the clinical actionability of CFs enable them to influence valuable healthcare decisions in real life; thereby, generating additional social value for clinical research in general and pragmatic clinical tri- als in particular.
This descriptive manner of conceptualizing CFs may be justified because several of the treatments that are evaluated in PCTs are usually by-products of prior",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:26,2023-11-06 14:10:26,66–68,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,X4QMXW96,0.0163339382940108,0.0,0.0158260799946754

Character education in and for humility, however, sits uncomfortably against today’s pedagogical maxims such as self-esteem and self-assertiveness. This article looks into this and other tensions from the perspective of humility as experience (phenomenon) instead of humility as goal. Surveying humility qua experience can help us to understand how the mind directs toward objects of cognition with their content, meaning and axiology. Husserl’s phenomenology and its theory of intuition suggests that humility is a personal belief (doxa) that moral agents construct out of their lived-experiences. Through iterations of similar lived-experiences, humility can become a habitus and, arguably, episteme. This process is detailed by intersecting experience of humility with intentionality, phenomenological reduction, and intersubjectivity. It is argued that, in contemporary education, ‘experience’ is widely accepted as learning content and teaching method. Humility as experience has significant implications for the main schools in curriculum studies, namely traditionalists, conceptualists and phenomenologists.

Clinical ethics support services, such as moral case deliberation (MCD), aim to assist them in dealing with these challenges. Yet, healthcare professionals can have different expectations and goals related to clinical ethics support services.                                         Methods               In this study, the perceptions held by healthcare professionals (nursing assistants, registered nurses, physicians, and others) regarding the importance of possible outcomes of MCDs, prior to implementation of MCDs, were investigated. A multisite, cross-sectional, quantitative study was performed at all six Paediatric Oncology Centres in Sweden. Healthcare professionals answered the Euro-MCD instrument with 26 potential MCD outcomes using a scale from Not important (1) to Very important (4). Descriptive and comparative statistical analyses were carried out.                                         Results               All outcomes were rated high, i.e., between 3.12 and 3.78. More open communication, developing skills to analyse ethically difficult situations, better mutual understanding, and deciding on concrete actions were rated as most important. Understanding of ethical theories and critical examination of policies were rated less important. Most often nursing assistants rated higher and physicians lower than the other professions did. Women and participants without previous experience of MCDs perceived outcomes as more important.

These schemes can lead to a conflict of interest as the hearing device dispenser is torn between personal reward over the best interests of their client. This conflict of interest has the potential for the dispenser to develop “moral distress”, a negative state of mind when an individual’s ethical values contrast with those of the employing organization. The purpose of this study was to investigate if there was a relationship between financial incentives and moral distress in Australian audiologists and audiometrists.                                         Methods               An online survey was distributed to all members of Audiology Australia and the Australian College of Audiology via email. Participants rated their perceived moral distress from 0 to 10 on the Moral Distress Thermometer and answered four questions about financial incentives in their respective workplace.                                         Results               A total of 65 participants, 42 females and 23 males, completed the online survey. A quarter of participants rated their moral distress corresponding to levels of uncomfortable or above. A statistically significant association was found between financial incentives, sales target setting, and higher perceived moral distress in participants.

However, the fact that we lacked a specific, highly effective treatment for COVID led many to argue that a COVID challenge trial would be unethical and we ought to pursue traditional phase III testing instead. These ethical objections to challenge trials may have slowed the progress of a COVID vaccine, so it is important to evaluate their merit. One common way of doing so is to make an analogy to other social practices that are relevantly similar and which we currently sanction. We submit that non‐directed live organ donation (NDLOD) is a promising analogy. After arguing that the risks to volunteers for each activity appear similar, we explore potential disanalogies that would undermine the comparison. We note that there are differences in both the kind and certainty of benefit secured by NDLOD compared to challenge trials. We conclude these differences are insufficient to make NDLOD permissible and challenge trials impermissible.

Although medical assistance in dying is most commonly provided for suffering associated with terminal somatic illness, some jurisdictions have also offered it for severe and irremediable psychiatric illness. Meanwhile, recent work in the philosophy of psychiatry has led to a renewed understanding of psychiatric illness that emphasises the role of the relation between the person and the external environment in the constitution of mental disorder. In this paper, I argue that this externalist approach to mental disorder highlights an ethical challenge to the practice of medical assistance in dying for psychiatric illness. At the level of the clinical assessment, externalism draws attention to potential social and environmental interventions that might have otherwise been overlooked by the standard approach to mental disorder, which may confound the judgement that there is no further reasonable alternative that could alleviate the person’s suffering. At the level of the wider society, externalism underscores how social prejudices and structural barriers that contribute to psychiatric illness constrain the affordances available to people and result in them seeking medical assistance in dying when they otherwise might not have had under better social conditions.",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:28,2023-11-06 14:10:28,553–557,,GW23Z4QV,0.0142180094786729,0.0,0.0134870064206435

Focusing on crime and courtroom dramas, I start by offering some examples of the cognitive benefits available in some of these series and I argue that the more beneficial cases establish superior mimetic relations with reality, enhancing their capacity to present ethically challenging issues. I then examine whether the fictional dimension of these works presents an obstacle to their informative potential and I conclude that it does not. A central aspect of my account is the claim that the degree of cognitive benefit depends on the underlying narrative strategy of the series. Specifically, there are clues in any given show, including the treatment of ongoing characters, which signal the extent to which it can be taken as mimetically reliable and thus, cognitively valuable.

This can be particularly difficult for people living with dementia. As cognition changes it is not uncommon for people living with dementia to have difficulties with their ability to orientate to time, place and person. These disorientating moments can lead to personal distress, and at times behavioural changes. As well as being distressing for the person living with dementia, it can also be emotionally and ethically challenging for acute hospital staff, including nurses. One area found to be particularly challenging is the concept of whether actively engaging with a person living with dementia's               living truth               is deceitful. This raises further questions of what forms of nurse responses to temporal disorientation might be constituted as lying, colluding, or alternatively validating. This article uses autoethnography as a research methodology with which to explore a mental health nurse's lived experience of the challenges of responding               truthfully               to disorientation and distress in an acute hospital.

The conclusion to the concept of               truth in dementia               is complex, nuanced and individualized.

It explores the manifestations of integrity violations and proceeds to draw an inference: an integrity violation can directly emanate from a misconception regarding integrity itself, as well as the implementation of protective measures that follow it. Integrity in its wholeness dimension is understood as open-endedness and non-seclusion rather than as a substantial, clearly definable characteristic of a person. This open-endedness and non-seclusion results from the relational constitution of an individual. Consequently, it follows that a violation of integrity occurs when the open-endedness and non-seclusion of a person and their relational Becoming is hindered. The new definition of integrity is particularly important when it comes to the governance of new health technologies, especially Digital Twins that can become representatives of a person.

In collectivistic oriented societies or families, children tend to be socialised to care for ageing parents and to experience guilt and shame if they violate this principle. Leaving the care to professional caregivers does not conform with the cultural expectations of many ethnic groups and becomes a sign of the family’s moral failure.                                         Research design:               Qualitative design with individual in-depth interviews with nurses, family members and dementia care coordinators in Norway, Montenegro, Serbia and South Africa. Braun and Clarke’s six analytic phases were used.                                         Ethical considerations:               The project was approved by the Regional Committee for Research, South-Eastern Norway; the Norwegian Centre for Research Data; the Ethics Committee; University of Limpopo, MEDUNSA Campus, South Africa; and by the local heads of the respective nursing homes or home care services.

Findings:               Healthcare professionals tend to be contacted only when the situation becomes unmanageable. Interviewees talked about feelings of obligation, shame and stigma in their societies regarding dementia, particularly in connection with institutionalisation of family members. Many lacked support during the decision-making process and were in a squeeze between their own needs and the patients’ need of professional care, and the feeling of duty and worry about being stigmatised by their surroundings. This conflict may be a source of pre-decision regret.

The aim of the article is to understand the role patronage plays in Africa from the perspective of a relevant African hermeneutic. Like many studies undertaken in an African setting, it uses a comparative methodology to create a dialogue between a socio-historical textual analysis of the biblical text and the socio-economic and religio-cultural realities of African contexts. It specifically uses an analogical paradigm that compares the reception of the biblical tradition in a specific historical critical context to its reception in modern-day African contexts. The result of the comparison is that the misuse of patronage is engaged from the perspective of the response of early Christian writers to patronage in the 1st century. This initial exploration has indicated that an analogous comparative approach has the potential to provide deeper insights in understanding the relationship established by patronage in African contexts. The conclusion is that in its engagement with patronage in Africa, the church must encourage its members to ask if it establishes parasitic or exploitative relations, if it is beneficial to the whole society over an extended period of time and if a clear distinction is made between public (offices) and personal resources. Ultimately, it needs to be asked if benefaction reflects the will of God and enhances the reputation of the congregation of God.

Interviews addressed animal welfare and conceptual issues associated with moral status and humanization of nonhuman animals that contain human cells. Our findings suggest that concepts of enhanced moral status and consciousness are not very useful in human–nonhuman‐animal chimeric research in part because their meanings are not easily defined, which presents challenges to applying the concepts in research.

CAPACITY DETERMINATION & SOFT PATERNALISM
Recent research indicates that as many as one third of patients with severe anorexia nervosa have diminished mental capacity to consent to treatment (Elzakkers et al. 2016). Thus, Ms. Johnson's care team is right to be concerned about her current capacity, though they are also correct to not simply assume that she lacks capacity because she has a psychiatric condition. Obtaining a capacity assessment is the appropriate first recommendation for the clinical ethics consultant to make in this case. Clinical ethicists typically charac- terize capacity as having four components: under- standing, appreciation, communication, and reasoning (Appelbaum and Grisso 1988). Dr. Garcia questions whether Ms. Johnson meets the understanding criter- ion of capacity, but it is also unclear whether Ms. Johnson meets the appreciation criterion, since it seems she fails to appreciate the ways in which her untreated illness will limit her health and her ability to resume college studies.
Given Ms. Johnson's dire medical status and Dr. Garcia's concern that Ms. Johnson's nutritional status is negatively impacting her cognition and decision- making, a case for (partial) intervention over Ms. Johnson's objections can be made by appealing to soft paternalism. Soft paternalism is the view that inter- vention in another's actions or decisions-even when she objects to such an intervention-is justified when the intervention is done in order to determine whether or not the individual is acting with capacity
(Feinberg 1986). While the vignette indicates that Ms. Johnson ""knows her medical team says she could die,"" it remains unclear whether 1) she believes them and 2) she actually understands this claim and what it entails for her health and her future goals. The fact that Ms. Johnson has knowledge of what has previ- ously been said to her about her condition is insuffi- cient evidence for understanding, since the understanding criterion requires that a patient grasp the information in a way that extends beyond rote memorization. Clarity on Ms. Johnson's understand- ing of her medical situation will require robust con- versations with her in order to ensure that her comprehension is not merely rote. Given that some of Ms. Johnson's preferences appear to conflict with each other-e.g., her desire to be healthy and her desire to not gain weight-it is unclear whether Ms. Johnson truly appreciates the consequences of her medical con- dition and its likely trajectory if she continues to refuse treatment.
Given Ms. Johnson's critical medical status and the fact that a thorough capacity assessment will take sig- nificant time, it is appropriate to place a feeding tube in order to physiologically and nutritionally stabilize Ms. Johnson so as to determine whether her refusals of treatment are capacitated and thus truly her own. Doing so will (1) grant the team the necessary time to assess her cognitive ability and capacity, and (2) allow them to see whether the improvement in her nutri- tional status changes her capacity and/or leads her to express different preferences.
Gloria's concerns about the effects of unwanted treatment on Ms. Johnson's trust of her parents and the medical team are well-taken, and strategies to mitigate these concerns ought to be pursued in tan- dem with Ms. Johnson's refeeding. Ms. Johnson's out- patient therapist, with whom Ms. Johnson reports having a good relationship, ought to be included in",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:27,2023-11-06 14:10:27,99–101,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,SD3Z7AL5,0.0103806228373702,0.0,0.0101105051470925

Some aspects of our identity are meant to be forgotten and there is a distinctive harm that accompanies the permanence of some content about us, content that prompts a duty to forget. To make the case that forgetting is an integral part of our moral duties to others, the paper proceeds as follows. In §1, I make the case that forgetting is morally evaluable and I survey three kinds of forgetting: no-trace forgetting, archival forgetting, and siloing. In §2, I turn to how we practice these forms of forgetting in our everyday lives and the goods these practices facilitate by drawing on examples ranging from the expunging of juvenile arrest records to the right to privacy. In §3, I turn to how my account can help us both recognize and address a heretofore neglected source of harm caused by technology and big data. In §4, I end by addressing the concern that we lack control over forgetting and thus can't be required to forget. I argue this challenge can be answered, but there's a harder challenge that can't.

With technological advances, the practice of using electronic informed consent (eIC) has emerged. However, a number of challenges hinder the successful and widespread deployment of eIC in clinical research. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the views of various stakeholders on the potential advantages and challenges of eIC.                                         Methods               Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 39 participants from 5 stakeholder groups from across 11 European countries. The stakeholder groups included physicians, patient organization representatives, regulator representatives, ethics committee members, and pharmaceutical industry representatives, and all were involved in clinical research. Interviews were analyzed using the framework method.                                         Results               Interviewees identified that a powerful feature of eIC is its personalized approach as it may increase participant empowerment. However, they identified several ethical and practical challenges, such as ensuring research participants are not overloaded with information and offering the same options to research participants who would prefer a paper-based informed consent rather than eIC. According to the interviewees, eIC has the potential to establish efficient long-term interactions between the research participants and the research team in order to keep the participants informed during and after the study. Interviewees emphasized that a personal interaction with the research team is of utmost importance and this cannot be replaced by an electronic platform. In addition, interviewees across the stakeholder groups supported the idea of having a harmonized eIC approach across the European Member States.                                         Conclusions               Interviewees reported a range of design and implementation challenges which needs to be overcome to foster innovation in informing research participants and obtaining their consent electronically. It was considered important that the implementation of eIC runs alongside the face-to-face contact between research participants and the research team. Moreover, interviewees expect that eIC could offer the opportunity to enable a personalized approach and to strengthen continuous communication over time. If successfully implemented, eIC may facilitate the engagement of research participants in clinical research.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:11,2023-11-06 14:05:11,1–12,Publisher: BioMed Central,EEHWG29S,0.0100401606425702,0.0,0.0096819917240117

Participants and research context:               Participants were invited to write down their experiences of a critical incident, which distressed them when providing nursing care.

Results:               A total of 111 critical incidents were written by 108 nurses. Four themes were found: (1) managing the pandemic, (2) witness to families’ grief, (3) our safety, and (4) futility of care.

Discussion:               Nurses experienced moral distress in relation to family and patient issues.

Complexity further increases if unconfirmed findings have been used to inform guidelines.

Pediatric nurses encounter stressful and ethically challenging situations when they care for suspected victims of child maltreatment. Data on pediatric nurses’ moral distress are limited, as most research in this field has been done in adult inpatient and intensive care units.                                         Aim:               The purpose of this study was to describe pediatric nurses’ moral distress and evaluate the impact of caring for suspected victims of child maltreatment on nurses’ moral distress, burnout, and intention to leave. Design and method: This descriptive cross-sectional correlational study was conducted in a mid-Atlantic, urban area Magnet pediatric level I trauma center that cares for over 1800 cases of suspected child maltreatment annually.

To examine the possibilities, the present study puts forward a functionality argument, which claims that if a human being and an AGI-enabled robot have similar functionality, but different creative processes, they may have similar moral status. Furthermore, the functionality argument asserts that an entity’s (a human being or an AGI-enabled robot) creation/production from carbon or silicon or its brain’s utilization of neurotransmitters or semiconductors does not carry any significance.

Do these entities have basic moral standing? Could they count as true friends or lovers? What should we do when we do not know the answer to these questions? An influential line of reasoning suggests that, in such cases of moral uncertainty, we need meta-moral decision rules that allow us to either minimize the risks of moral wrongdoing or improve the choice-worthiness of our actions. One particular argument adopted in this literature is the “risk asymmetry argument,” which claims that the risks associated with accepting or rejecting some moral facts may be sufficiently asymmetrical as to warrant favoring a particular practical resolution of this uncertainty. Focusing on the case study of artificial beings, this article argues that this is best understood as an ethical-epistemic challenge. The article argues that taking potential risk asymmetries seriously can help resolve disputes about the status of human–AI relationships, at least in practical terms (philosophical debates will, no doubt, continue); however, the resolution depends on a proper, empirically grounded assessment of the risks involved.
