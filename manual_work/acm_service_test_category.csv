This empirical research investigates how the ethics of AI is translated into practice and the challenges of its implementation by public service organizations. Using the Value Sensitive Design as a framework of inquiry, semi-structured interviews are conducted with eight public service organizations across the Estonian government that have piloted or developed an AI solution for delivering a public service. Results show that the practical application of AI ethical principles is indirectly considered and demonstrated in different ways in the design and development of the AI. However, translation of these principles varies according to the maturity of the AI and the public servant's level of awareness, knowledge, and competences in AI. Data-related challenges persist as public service organizations work on fine-tuning their AI applications.",Ethics; Artificial Intelligence; AI Ethical Principles; Estonia; Ethical AI Design and Development; Practical Application of AI Ethics; Public Sector; Value Sensitive Design,,1947-3451,2023-04,2023-11-06 01:29:59,2023-11-06 01:29:59,1–15,,,3Z9FZKRF,0.1276595744680851,0.5909090909090909,0.25,0.2018186327252825

The aim of the project is to build solutions that can make it easier for older individuals to live at home, such as, robots, wearables and sensor technologies that apply artificial intelligence (AI). The guiding method of the design process of ethical guidelines is Alan Hevner’s Design Science Research. Theoretical background consists of a form of literature overview, which contains the most relevant ethical theories and research on AI ethics, machine ethics and human rights. This article introduces the process of building the ethical guidelines for the SHAPES project and further discussion if providing guidelines is the sufficient tool to developers to take ethical action in development of the AI systems. The SHAPES guidelines include the following themes; accountability, transparency and explainability, diversity, inclusion and fairness, safety and security and societal wellbeing and humanity.",Design Science Reseach; Ethical Competence; Ethical Guidelines; SHAPES,,1877-0509,2021-01,2023-11-06 01:30:03,2023-11-06 01:30:03,2330–2339,,,9ZGXWGLX,0.1341463414634146,0.75,0.3333333333333333,0.1816468560255222

Notwithstanding its promising nature, however, AI in healthcare embodies certain ethical challenges as well. This research aims to delineate the most influential elements of scientific research on AI ethics in healthcare by conducting bibliometric, social network analysis, and cluster-based content analysis of scientific articles. Not only did the bibliometric analysis identify the most influential authors, countries, institutions, sources, and documents, but it also recognized four ethical concerns associated with 12 medical issues. These ethical categories are composed of normative, meta-ethics, epistemological and medical practice. The content analysis complemented this list of ethical categories and distinguished seven more ethical categories: ethics of relationships, medico-legal concerns, ethics of robots, ethics of ambient intelligence, patients' rights, physicians’ rights, and ethics of predictive analytics. This analysis likewise identified 40 general research gaps in the literature and plausible future research strands. This analysis furthers conversations on the ethics of AI and associated emerging technologies such as nanotech and biotech in healthcare, hence, advances convergence research on the ethics of AI in healthcare. Practically, this research will provide a map for policymakers and AI engineers and scientists on what dimensions of AI-based medical interventions require stricter policies and guidelines and robust ethical design and development.",Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Content analysis; Healthcare; Bibliometric analysis; Network visualization; Robotics,,0010-4825,2021-08,2023-11-06 01:30:04,2023-11-06 01:30:04,,,,2BYKVZ92,0.1761904761904762,0.1818181818181818,0.1333333333333333,0.1738921640697445

The first is presenting the main results of the recent report Ethics of Connected and Automated Vehicles: recommendations on road safety, privacy, fairness, explainability and responsibility written by the Horizon 2020 European Commission Expert Group to advise on specific ethical issues raised by driverless mobility, of which the author of this paper has been member and rapporteur. The second is presenting some broader ethical and philosophical implications of these recommendations, and using these to contribute to the establishment of Ethics of Transportation as an independent&nbsp;branch of applied ethics. The recent debate on the ethics of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) presents a paradox and an opportunity. The paradox is the presence of a flourishing debate on the ethics of one very specific transportation technology without ethics of transportation being in itself a well-established academic discipline. The opportunity is that now that a spotlight has been switched on the ethical dimensions of CAVs it may be easier to establish a broader debate on ethics of transportation. While the 20 recommendations of the EU report are grouped in three macro-areas: road safety, data ethics, and responsibility, in this paper they will be grouped according to eight philosophical themes: Responsible Innovation, road justice, road safety, freedom, human control, privacy, data fairness, responsibility. These are proposed as the first topics for a new ethics of transportation.",Ethics of self-driving cars; Ethics of transportation; European Commission Report on ethics of CAVs; Responsible innovation in self-driving cars,,1388-1957,2021-12,2023-11-06 01:30:04,2023-11-06 01:30:04,713–726,,,BSYCZR64,0.1541850220264317,0.3157894736842105,0.2222222222222222,0.1717578331536133

Incidents with AI are studied in relation to five sectors (police, healthcare, education and academia, politics, automotive) using the AIAAIC repository. A total of 125 incidents are sampled and analyzed by conducting a qualitative content analysis on media reports. The results show that certain ethical principles are found breached across sectors: accuracy/reliability, bias/discrimination, transparency, surveillance/privacy, security. However, results also show that 1) some ethical issues (misinformation, safety, premise/intent) are sector specific, 2) the consequences and meaning of the same ethical issue is able to vary across sectors and 3) pre-existing sector-specific issues are reproduced with these ethical breaches. The paper concludes that general ethical principles are relevant to discuss across sectors, yet, a sector-based approach to AI ethics gives in-depth information on sector-specific structural issues.",,9798400702310,,2023,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2023-11-06 01:29:48,705–714,AIES '23,Association for Computing Machinery,4REIZHKM,0.1447368421052631,0.0,0.375,0.1672564663492472

I contribute an implementation of automated Kantian ethics that is faithful to the Kantian philosophical tradition.
