This transformation has produced novel ethical challenges. The digitalization of health records, bioinformatics, molecular medicine, wearable biomedical technologies, biotechnology, and synthetic biology has created new biological data niches. How these data are shared, stored, distributed, and analyzed has created ethical problems regarding privacy, trust, accountability, fairness, and justice. This study investigates issues related to data-sharing permissions, fairness in secondary data distribution, and commercial and political conflicts of interest among individuals, companies, and states. In conclusion, establishing an agency to act as deputy trustee on behalf of individuals is recommended to intermediate the complex nature of informed consent. Focusing on decentralized digital technologies is recommended in order to catalyze the utilization of data and prevent discrimination without circulating data unnecessarily.",,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:09,2023-11-06 14:05:09,320–333,,VEQ6XXYR,0.1397058823529411,0.7142857142857143,0.1618051066580478

However, they are unclear about which kind of responsibility concept to use when dis- cussing the ethically salient characteristics of digital twins. While we agree that achieving the ethical devel- opment of digital simulacra requires epistemic respon- sibility, we propose the inclusion of the Ubuntu perspective as an addendum to strengthen the
argument for epistemic responsibility in this context. Ubuntu, a pan-African philosophy, could specify how to conceptualize epistemic responsibility by highlight- ing the importance of forward-looking collective responsibility. In the rest of this commentary, we will argue that this is an ethically fruitful orientation in the context of digital twins.
Ubuntu is a concept originating from Southern Africa that encourages close connections and mutual reliance between people in a society (Metz 2007). The word ""Ubuntu"" is frequently used in the IsiZulu",,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:27,2023-11-06 14:10:27,91–93,Publisher: Taylor & Francis,IAWLANAZ,0.1226993865030674,0.2727272727272727,0.1328247253264294

The students were asked to choose a most significant moral problem of AI applications in the future from a list of ten ethical issues and to write an essay about it. The results show that most of the students (n = 269, 58%) considered unemployment to be the major ethical issue related to AI. The second largest group of students (n = 54, 12%) was concerned with ethical issues related to emotional AI, including the impact of AI on human behavior and emotion and robots’ rights and emotions. A relatively small number of students referred to the risk of social control by AI (6%), AI discrimination (6%), increasing inequality (5%), loss of privacy (4%), AI mistakes (3%), malicious AI (3%), and AI security breaches (3%). Calculation of the z score for two population proportions shows that Japanese students were much less concerned about AI control of society (− 3.1276, p < 0.01) than non-Japanese students, but more concerned about discrimination (2.2757, p < 0.05). Female students were less concerned about unemployment (− 2.6108, p < 0.01) than males, but more concerned about discrimination (2.4333, p < 0.05).
