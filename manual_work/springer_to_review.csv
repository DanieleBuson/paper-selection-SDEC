Ethical mindedness, guided by defensible, high standards, is a disposition and a practice that encompasses respect and impartiality regarding individuals, teams, organizations and phenomena. Ethical imagination is the capability to examine and identify potential ethical issues in novel situations and create ethical ways to confront them. To ensure that ethical practices occur in higher education research, institutional ethics committees are required to examine the ethical implication of each research application based on publicly espoused regulatory ethical guidelines and standards. However, ethics committees can only call for compliance with regulations and standards but cannot ensure that all researchers will exercise ethical behaviour when they are confronted with unforeseen ethically ambiguous conditions. For this reason, in this chapter, we assert that assuring ethical research practices requires more than ensuring compliance with a set of rules. Ethics should be viewed as a knowledge discipline, incorporating attributes of ethical mindedness and ethical imagination that are fostered as graduate dispositions and capabilities that contribute to the development of ethically-minded business professionals. To conclude the chapter, we will generate a conceptual framework for situating the role of ethical mindedness and ethical imagination in a supportive institutional climate and culture in postgraduate professions-oriented research education.

Ethical issues undeniably permeate all research, and it is important that questions of ethical practice in research and the ethical foundations of research be addressed along a broad spectrum of issues that includes research processes, methods, and purposes; forms of interpretation; and issues related to the values and ethical choices of those who conduct the research. Research ethics introduces complexity into research processes. While the standards and ethical principles of research may (often) seem very simple, ethical dilemmas and controversies abound in research practice. Research ethics is about conducting research responsibly and in a morally defensible manner while adhering to relevant ethical principles. Many researchers in the field of social inclusion would certainly agree that the ethical lens needs to go beyond a legalistic and codified understanding of research ethics to address the sociopolitical embeddedness of ethical principles and how research can serve as a means of providing knowledge, improving social justice, realizing human rights, and mobilizing social equality and inclusion. In this context, this chapter raises issues related to research ethics and integrity and suggests possible ethical considerations for research from its inception to possible social action, calling for researchers to develop ethical awareness.

Along with trust in AI, we examine perceptions of the importance of seven ethics requirements of AI offered by the European Commission’s High-Level Expert Group. Then the association between ethics requirements and trust is evaluated through regression analysis. Findings suggest that the ethical requirement of societal and environmental well-being is positively associated with human-like trust in AI. Accountability and technical robustness are two other ethical requirements, which are significantly associated with functionality trust in AI.

Ramayah,2022.0,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13520-022-00143-4,Article,"Corruption devours profits, people, and the planet. Ethical leaders promote ethical behaviors. We develop a first-stage moderated mediation theoretical model, explore the intricate relationships between ethical leadership (member rated, Time 1) and employee ethical behaviors (leader rated, Time 3), and treat ethical climate and organizational justice (member rated, 
Time 2) as dual mediators and leaders’ moral attentiveness (leader rated, Time 3) as a moderator. We investigate leadership from two perspectives—leaders’ self-evaluation of moral attentiveness and members’ perceptions of ethical leadership. We theorize: These dual mediation mechanisms are more robust for high moral leaders than low moral leaders. Our three-wave data collected from multiple sources, 236 members and 98 immediate supervisors in the Republic of Iraq, support our theory. Specifically, ethical leadership robustly impacts organizational justice’s intensity and magnitude, leading to high employee ethical behaviors when leaders’ moral attentiveness is high than low. However, ethical leadership only influences the ethical climate’s intensity but has no impact on the magnitude when leaders’ moral attentiveness is high than low. Therefore, organizational justice is a more robust mediator than the ethical climate in the omnibus context of leader moral attentiveness. Our findings support Western theory and constructs, demonstrating a new theory for Muslims in Arabic’s emerging markets. Individual decision-makers (subordinates) apply their values (ethical leadership) as a lens to frame their concerns in the immediate (organizational justice and ethical climate) and omnibus (leader moral attentiveness) contexts to maximize their expected utility and ultimate serenity-happiness. Ethical leadership trickles down to employee ethical behaviors, providing practical implications for improving the ethical environment, corporate social responsibility, leader-member exchange (LMX), business ethics, and economic potentials in the global competitive markets.",,0.1902985074626865,0.8571428571428571,0.2074459335973195

In particular, the rise of AI and autonomous systems has corresponded to an improvement in computational power and in solving complex problems. However, the resulting possibilities have been coupled with an upsurge of ethical risks. To avoid the misuse, underuse, and harmful use of data and data-based systems like AI, we should use an ethical framework appropriate to the object of its reasoning. Unfortunately, in recent years, the space for data-related ethics has not been precisely defined in organisations. As a consequence, there has been an overlapping of responsibilities and a void of clear accountabilities. Ethical issues have, therefore, been dealt with using inadequate levels of abstraction (e.g. legal, technical). Yet, if building an ethical infrastructure requires the collaboration of each body, addressing ethical issues related to data requires leaving room for the appropriate level of abstraction. This paper first aims to show how the space of data ethics is already latent in organisations. It then highlights how to redefine roles (chief data ethics officer, data ethics committee, etc.) and codes (code of data ethics) to create and maintain an environment where ethical reasoning about data, information, and AI systems may flourish.",,0.1884057971014492,0.5,0.1952322425359758

It is thought that displaying ethical behavior and providing digital security in digital environments can increase sensitivity to cyberbullying. Here, it is necessary to learn and apply the concepts of digital ethics and security correctly. For this reason, we can say that the places where we can learn and apply these concepts in the best way are educational environments. Therefore, the adoption of digital ethics and digital security concepts by pre-service teachers, both for themselves and for their future students, will raise awareness about the sensitivity to cyberbullying. This study also revealed that the concepts of digital ethics and security should be considered to increase the sensitivity of pre-service teachers to cyberbullying. In the research, the scanning model, one of the quantitative research designs, was used. Data were collected from 879 pre-service teachers studying at a state university. Within the scope of the research, three scales were used for pre-service teachers: “Cyberbullying Sensitivity Scale,“ “Digital Data Security Scale” and “The information and Communication Technologies Usage Ethics Scale.“ T-test, ANOVA, MANOVA, and regression tests were used in the analysis of the data. Because of the research, it was seen that the digital data security awareness, cyberbullying sensitivities, and digital ethics perceptions of pre-service teachers did not differ according to grade level, but differed according to gender and department level. Additionally, while digital data security awareness did not differ according to the department, it did not differ according to the combined effect of gender and department variables. Additionally, it was concluded that digital data security awareness predicts sensitivity to cyberbullying. Suggestions were made regarding the findings obtained at the end of the research.",,0.1705685618729097,0.4117647058823529,0.1856985397709379

Project ECHO (Extension for Community Health Outcomes) is theoretically linked to improved sensemaking. This study examines the effectiveness of ECHO and training in use of sensemaking approaches to ethical response by clinicians. A quasi-experimental design study using univariate linear regression was used to examine the effect of the three types of ethics training on ethical response self-efficacy scores, while controlling for participant characteristics of years in practice, discipline and sex. We found evidence that training in sensemaking through participation in ECHO promotes improved ethical response self-efficacy of clinicians.

Data creep has proven controversial and has prompted concerns about the scope of ethical oversight. Institutional review boards offer little guidance regarding big data, and problematic research can still meet ethical standards. While ethics seem concrete through institutional deployment, I frame ethics as produced. Informed by my ethnographic research at a large public university in the U.S., I explore ethics through two models: ethics as institutional procedures and ethics as acts and intentions. The university where I conducted fieldwork is the development grounds for a predictive model that uses student data to anticipate academic success. While students consent to data collection, the circumstances of consent and the degree to which they are informed are not so apparent, as many data are a product of creep. Drawing from interviews and participant observation with administrators, data scientists, developers, and students, I examine data ethics, from a larger institutional model to everyday enactments related to data creep.

We know that computers in general and the processing of data, the use of artificial intelligence, and the combination of computers and/or artificial intelligence with robotics are all associated with ethically relevant implications for individuals, groups, and society. In this article, we argue that while all technologies are ethically relevant, there is no need to create a separate ‘ethics of X’ or ‘X ethics’ for each and every subtype of technology or technological property—e.g. computer ethics, AI ethics, data ethics, information ethics, robot ethics, and machine ethics. Specific technologies might have specific impacts, but we argue that they are often sufficiently covered and understood through already established higher-level domains of ethics. Furthermore, the proliferation of tech ethics is problematic because (a) the conceptual boundaries between the subfields are not well-defined, (b) it leads to a duplication of effort and constant reinventing the wheel, and (c) there is danger that participants overlook or ignore more fundamental ethical insights and truths. The key to avoiding such outcomes lies in a taking the discipline of ethics seriously, and we consequently begin with a brief description of what ethics is, before presenting the main forms of technology related ethics. Through this process, we develop a hierarchy of technology ethics, which can be used by developers and engineers, researchers, or regulators who seek an understanding of the ethical implications of technology. We close by deducing two principles for positioning ethical analysis which will, in combination with the hierarchy, promote the leveraging of existing knowledge and help us to avoid an exaggerated proliferation of tech ethics.",,0.1605839416058394,0.4545454545454545,0.1716036181732695

Utilizing expert workshops and encounters as well as a scientific literature review, ethical issues are mapped on individual steps of digital service chains. Not surprisingly, the results demonstrate that ethical challenges cannot be resolved in a general way, but need to be discussed individually and with respect to the ethical principles that are violated in the specific step of the service chain.

Using a path modeling methodology, we find evidence that, for ethics, moral disengagement is an antecedent to the TPB predictors of attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (PBC). We show that the TPB predictors mediate the influence moral disengagement has on ethical behavioral intentions. Thus, to improve ethical behavior, reducing moral disengagement is critical. We find support for including both types of PBC (self-efficacy and locus of control) when modeling ethical behavior. We use four ethics scenarios and international data to test this model. We also evaluate potential positive influences on ethics in the workplace and find that recency of ethics training interacts with religiosity and activates it to reduce moral disengagement. We also find that principles-based ethics training enhances professionals’ self-efficacy to behave ethically. Experience, including time as a member in a professional accounting organization, increases both locus of control and self-efficacy to behave ethically. These variables—recency of ethical training, religiosity, principles-based professional ethics training, and experience—influence parts of the core TPB model, which in turn lead to improved ethical behavioral intentions.",,0.160427807486631,0.1666666666666666,0.1608199391723818

The participants were 262 undergraduate students (116 males and 164 females) who took an online university elective course at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in Spring of 2021. The study adopted a quantitative approach to data collection to investigate students’ digital citizenship practices. An online situational judgment test was developed and conducted to address six dimensions of digital citizenship: digital identity, digital civic engagement, digital ethics, digital literacy, digital safety, and global digital communication. The findings show that the level of practicing digital citizenship dimensions ranged from intermediate to low. Additionally, the results show that the least practiced dimensions are digital civic engagement and digital identity. Further, the results indicated some gender differences in students’ practices of digital citizenship. Considering the results, more efforts are required from stakeholders to enhance the level of DC among undergraduates.

Yet realizing the potential of AI necessitates a better understanding of the various ethical issues involved with deciding to use AI, training and maintaining it, and allowing it to make decisions that have moral consequences. People want organizations using AI and the AI systems themselves to behave ethically, but ethical behavior means different things to different people, and many ethical dilemmas require trade-offs such that no course of action is universally considered ethical. How should organizations using AI—and the AI itself—process ethical dilemmas where humans disagree on the morally right course of action? Though a variety of ethical AI frameworks have been suggested, these approaches do not adequately address how people make ethical evaluations of AI systems or how to incorporate the fundamental disagreements people have regarding what is and is not ethical behavior. Drawing on moral foundations theory, we theorize that a person will perceive an organization’s use of AI, its data procedures, and the resulting AI decisions as ethical to the extent that those decisions resonate with the person’s moral foundations. Since people hold diverse moral foundations, this highlights the crucial need to consider individual moral differences at multiple levels of AI. We discuss several unresolved issues and suggest potential approaches (such as moral reframing) for thinking about conflicts in moral judgments concerning AI.",,0.1694214876033057,0.0,0.1591097133293844
