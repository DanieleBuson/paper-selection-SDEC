Pincay,2021.0,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9530972,IEEE Conferences,"Dynamically developing digitization initiatives among public institutions and private companies necessitate a balanced approach to digital ethics. Several frameworks and legal regulations have been adopted to clarify and define the various ethical challenges in digital contexts. These initiatives often accentuate one of three components: data security, data governance, or digital strategy. However, an integrated approach is required to meet the current demand for an ethical and sustainable approach to digitalization and address the growing number of challenges occurring in handling data and related peripheral components. This paper develops the concept of an integrated framework to incorporate all relevant aspects of digital ethics by combining three categories of digital contexts: law and regulations, ethics and justice, and environmental sustainability. The core of this integrated framework, the Fribourg sustainable digital ethics framework (FSDEF), consists of two boundary conditions of sustainable development: social thresholds of justice and ecological planetary boundaries. It also incorporates numerous other frameworks and standards, including value-based engineering and IEEE standards.",Digital ethics;sustainability;corporate digital responsibility,978-3-030-78269-6,2573-1998,2021,2023-11-06 01:30:04,2023-11-06 01:30:04,24–28,,IEEE,EJS6LDIG,0.1925465838509316,1.25,0.375,0.2505032957755626,"UniFR_ESH Institute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; UniFR_ESH Institute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland",13 Sep 2021,156.0,162.0,978-1-6654-2512-4,,Ethics;Law;Data security;Green products;Companies;IEEE Standards;Regulation,data governance;environmental factors;ethical aspects;IEEE standards;law;public administration;security of data;sustainable development,sustainable digitalization;digitization initiatives;legal regulations;data security;data governance;digital strategy;peripheral components;justice;environmental sustainability;Fribourg sustainable digital ethics framework;sustainable development;ethical digitalization;data handling;law;regulations;ethics;FSDEF;value-based engineering;IEEE standards;public institutions;private companies,,2.0,20.0,IEEE,13 Sep 2021,

Also, the study investigated the moderating role of employee moral identity on the relationship between ethical climate and employees’ ethical behaviour. Data were collected from 620 full-time employees working at thirty-three Iraqi organisations from five Iraqi provinces. These organisations were from various industry sectors such as manufacturing, retailing, medical, insurance, information technology, legal, finance, and telecommunication sectors. The study found that ethical leadership impacted on the ethical behaviour of employees and the ethical climate also significantly mediated the relationship between ethical leadership and employees’ ethical behaviour.

In part, this results from disagreements about the goal of this education, which inhibit the development of and progress in cohesive research agendas and practices. In this regard, engineering ethics faces challenges like other professional ethics. To address these issues, this paper argues that the ultimate goal of engineering ethics education should be more long-term ethical behaviors, but that engineering ethics must more fully engage with the fields of empirical moral and cultural psychology to do so. It begins by considering reasons for adopting ethical behaviors as the ultimate goal of ethics education, and moves on to discuss why ethical behaviors have not been adopted as the goal of ethics education. The paper ends by considering responses to these problems, why ethical behaviors should still be adopted as the ultimate goal of ethics education.",,9798400700446,,2023.0,2023-11-06 14:10:27,2023-11-06 14:10:27,33–53,EASE '23,Wiley,4WTVSKX8,0.2,0.0,0.4166666666666667,0.2165888577653283,,,91.0,165.0,9781119831792,,Ethics;Artificial intelligence;Medical services;Companies;Technological innovation;Standards organizations;Law,,,,,,,12 Jul 2022,

This paper explores ethical issues in making use of digital phenotype data in the arena of digital health interventions. Products and services based on digital wellbeing technologies typically include mobile device apps as well as browser-based apps to a lesser extent, and can include telephony-based services, text-based chatbots, and voice-activated chatbots. Many of these digital products and services are simultaneously available across many channels in order to maximize availability for users. Digital wellbeing technologies offer useful methods for real-time data capture of the interactions of users with the products and services. It is possible to design what data are recorded, how and where it may be stored, and, crucially, how it can be analyzed to reveal individual or collective usage patterns. The paper also examines digital phenotyping workflows, before enumerating the ethical concerns pertaining to different types of digital phenotype data, highlighting ethical considerations for collection, storage, and use of the data. A case study of a digital health app is used to illustrate the ethical issues. The case study explores the issues from a perspective of data prospecting and subsequent machine learning. The ethical use of machine learning and artificial intelligence on digital phenotype data and the broader issues in democratizing machine learning and artificial intelligence for digital phenotype data are then explored in detail.",,978-3-030-77430-1,,2021.0,2023-11-06 14:05:11,2023-11-06 14:05:11,1945–1960,,Springer-Verlag,4UZY4DMG,0.1900826446280991,0.875,0.4117647058823529,0.2059533534807806,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer Verlag

However, there is disagreement about what is the best ethical framework for understanding those issues. In this paper we seek to address this shortcoming through the introduction of a principlist ethical framework for cybersecurity that builds on existing work in adjacent fields of applied ethics, bioethics, and AI ethics. By redeploying the AI4People framework, we develop a domain-relevant specification of five ethical principles in cybersecurity: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and explicability. We then illustrate the advantages of this principlist framework by examining the ethical issues raised by four common cybersecurity contexts: penetration testing, distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS), ransomware, and system administration. These case analyses demonstrate the utility of this principlist framework as a basis for understanding cybersecurity ethics and for cultivating the ethical expertise and ethical sensitivity of cybersecurity professionals and other stakeholders.",AI ethics; Privacy; Cybersecurity ethics; DDoS attacks; Penetration testing; Principlism; Ransomware,,0167-4048,2021-10,2023-11-06 01:29:59,2023-11-06 01:29:59,,,,VXFLFHHR,0.2027027027027027,0.5454545454545454,0.3333333333333333,0.2349071940017134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Investigating and understanding why companies engage in such severe AI ethical malpractices is essential to correct them as they seriously jeopardize the future development of AI. Based on a sample of 34 companies, out of which 23 were sanctioned under GDPR due to severe violations of AI ethical principles and using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, this study demonstrates that to be an AI ethical company and comply with the GDPR regulation, it is necessary to have an AI ethical statement, have a very strong concern for information cybersecurity, and have to be based in a country considered ethical or monitor with care the behavior of the firm in countries with lower ethical standards. As a theoretical contribution, although some authors argue that AI ethical principles are useless, the present research introduces a new theoretical perspective by demonstrating cause–effect relationships between business configurations and AI ethical failures. In addition, the results have an important managerial relevance because they show that lack of an AI ethical statement is the most relevant condition that led to ethical misbehaviors.",Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics;General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance;fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA);prohibited ai practices,978-1-4503-9247-1,1558-0040,2022,2023-11-06 01:29:57,2023-11-06 01:29:57,92–106,AIES '22,IEEE,H9LSTATR,0.1941747572815534,0.2,0.0,0.1853137404945239,"ESIC University, ESIC Business and Marketing School, Madrid, Spain; ESIC University, ESIC Business and Marketing School, Madrid, Spain; ESIC University, ESIC Business and Marketing School, Madrid, Spain; ESIC University, ESIC Business and Marketing School, Madrid, Spain",,1.0,10.0,,ESIC University(grant numbers:1-M-2017); ,Ethics;Companies;Artificial intelligence;Regulation;Behavioral sciences;Security;General Data Protection Regulation,,,,3.0,,IEEE,28 Mar 2023,

SchultzPeter Seele,2023.0,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-022-00150-y,Article,"This paper proposes to generate awareness for developing Artificial intelligence (AI) ethics by transferring knowledge from other fields of applied ethics, particularly from business ethics, stressing the role of organizations and processes of institutionalization. With the rapid development of AI systems in recent years, a new and thriving discourse on AI ethics has (re-)emerged, dealing primarily with ethical concepts, theories, and application contexts. We argue that business ethics insights may generate positive knowledge spillovers for AI ethics, given that debates on ethical and social responsibilities have been adopted as voluntary or mandatory regulations for organizations in both national and transnational contexts. Thus, business ethics may transfer knowledge from five core topics and concepts researched and institutionalized to AI ethics: (1) stakeholder management, (2) standardized reporting, (3) corporate governance and regulation, (4) curriculum accreditation, and as a unified topic (5) AI ethics washing derived from greenwashing. In outlining each of these five knowledge bridges, we illustrate current challenges in AI ethics and potential insights from business ethics that may advance the current debate. At the same time, we hold that business ethics can learn from AI ethics in catching up with the digital transformation, allowing for cross-fertilization between the two fields. Future debates in both disciplines of applied ethics may benefit from dialog and cross-fertilization, meant to strengthen the ethical depth and prevent ethics washing or, even worse, ethics bashing.",,,2329-924X,2021-06,2023-11-06 01:29:48,2023-11-06 01:29:48,609–622,,IEEE,GFZ5PDIF,0.222707423580786,0.4444444444444444,0.5714285714285714,0.2459017162369429,"M3S.

However, they are unclear about which kind of responsibility concept to use when dis- cussing the ethically salient characteristics of digital twins. While we agree that achieving the ethical devel- opment of digital simulacra requires epistemic respon- sibility, we propose the inclusion of the Ubuntu perspective as an addendum to strengthen the
argument for epistemic responsibility in this context. Ubuntu, a pan-African philosophy, could specify how to conceptualize epistemic responsibility by highlight- ing the importance of forward-looking collective responsibility. In the rest of this commentary, we will argue that this is an ethically fruitful orientation in the context of digital twins.

Ethical mindedness, guided by defensible, high standards, is a disposition and a practice that encompasses respect and impartiality regarding individuals, teams, organizations and phenomena. Ethical imagination is the capability to examine and identify potential ethical issues in novel situations and create ethical ways to confront them. To ensure that ethical practices occur in higher education research, institutional ethics committees are required to examine the ethical implication of each research application based on publicly espoused regulatory ethical guidelines and standards. However, ethics committees can only call for compliance with regulations and standards but cannot ensure that all researchers will exercise ethical behaviour when they are confronted with unforeseen ethically ambiguous conditions. For this reason, in this chapter, we assert that assuring ethical research practices requires more than ensuring compliance with a set of rules. Ethics should be viewed as a knowledge discipline, incorporating attributes of ethical mindedness and ethical imagination that are fostered as graduate dispositions and capabilities that contribute to the development of ethically-minded business professionals. To conclude the chapter, we will generate a conceptual framework for situating the role of ethical mindedness and ethical imagination in a supportive institutional climate and culture in postgraduate professions-oriented research education.

Institutional Ethics Committee is a type of that effort to identify, analyze, and resolve ethical issues but also used interchangeably with ethics consultation. Each function of institutional ethics committees refers to a substantial role in the therapeutic relationship. However, ethics education carries a higher potential to increase ethical knowledge, improve ethical skills, develop ethical behavior, and promote cultural competence by providing committee members, healthcare professionals, and patients and their families with continuous educational activities. Performing ethics consultation through bioethicists and other professionals having education in bioethics would help to achieve these goals and enhance the impact of bioethicists in clinical decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,0.2039473684210526,,0.6666666666666666,0.22456553766593,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

33,What Does It Mean to Embed Ethics in Data Science? An Integrative Approach Based on Microethics and Virtues,AI Soc.,36.0,3,10.1007/s00146-020-01112-w,"Bezuidenhout, Louise; Ratti, Emanuele",2021.0,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-020-01112-w,journalArticle,"In the past few years, scholars have been questioning whether the current approach in data ethics based on the higher level case studies and general principles is effective. In particular, some have been complaining that such an approach to ethics is difficult to be applied and to be taught in the context of data science. In response to these concerns, there have been discussions about how ethics should be “embedded” in the practice of data science, in the sense of showing how ethical issues emerge in small technical choices made by data scientists in their day-to-day activities, and how such an approach can be used to teach data ethics. However, a precise description of how such proposals have to be theoretically conceived and could be operationalized has been lacking. In this article, we propose a full-fledged characterization of ‘embedding’ ethics, and how this can be applied especially to the problem of teaching data science ethics. Using the emerging model of ‘microethics’, we propose a way of teaching daily responsibility in digital activities that is connected to (and draws from) the higher level ethical challenges discussed in digital/data ethics. We ground this microethical approach into a virtue theory framework, by stressing that the goal of a microethics is to foster the cultivation of moral virtues. After delineating this approach of embedding ethics in theoretical detail, this article discusses a concrete example of how such a ‘micro-virtue ethics’ approach could be practically taught to data science students.",Embedded ethics; Data science; Virtue ethics; Microethics; Teaching ethics,,0951-5666,2021-09,2023-11-06 01:30:03,2023-11-06 01:30:03,939–953,,,B9TXHEP8,0.1387755102040816,0.7777777777777778,0.1666666666666666,0.167833615141625,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on a qualitative analysis of technology workers tasked with integrating AI ethics into product development, we find that workers experience an environment where policies, practices, and outcomes are decoupled. We analyze AI ethics workers as ethics entrepreneurs who work to institutionalize new ethics-related practices within organizations. We show that ethics entrepreneurs face three major barriers to their work. First, they struggle to have ethics prioritized in an environment centered around software product launches. Second, ethics are difficult to quantify in a context where company goals are incentivized by metrics. Third, the frequent reorganization of teams makes it difficult to access knowledge and maintain relationships central to their work. Consequently, individuals take on great personal risk when raising ethics issues, especially when they come from marginalized backgrounds.

There are numerous initiatives that aim to develop the principles and guidance to ensure that the development, deployment and use of AI are ethically acceptable. What is generally unclear is how organisations that make use of AI understand and address these ethical issues in practice. While there is an abundance of conceptual work on AI ethics, empirical insights are rare and often anecdotal. This paper fills the gap in our current understanding of how organisations deal with AI ethics by presenting empirical findings collected using a set of ten case studies and providing an account of the cross-case analysis. The paper reviews the discussion of ethical issues of AI as well as mitigation strategies that have been proposed in the literature. Using this background, the cross-case analysis categorises the organisational responses that were observed in practice. The discussion shows that organisations are highly aware of the AI ethics debate and keen to engage with ethical issues proactively. However, they make use of only a relatively small subsection of the mitigation strategies proposed in the literature.

We know that computers in general and the processing of data, the use of artificial intelligence, and the combination of computers and/or artificial intelligence with robotics are all associated with ethically relevant implications for individuals, groups, and society. In this article, we argue that while all technologies are ethically relevant, there is no need to create a separate ‘ethics of X’ or ‘X ethics’ for each and every subtype of technology or technological property—e.g. computer ethics, AI ethics, data ethics, information ethics, robot ethics, and machine ethics. Specific technologies might have specific impacts, but we argue that they are often sufficiently covered and understood through already established higher-level domains of ethics. Furthermore, the proliferation of tech ethics is problematic because (a) the conceptual boundaries between the subfields are not well-defined, (b) it leads to a duplication of effort and constant reinventing the wheel, and (c) there is danger that participants overlook or ignore more fundamental ethical insights and truths. The key to avoiding such outcomes lies in a taking the discipline of ethics seriously, and we consequently begin with a brief description of what ethics is, before presenting the main forms of technology related ethics.

In turn, AI ethics is a part of the broader field of digital ethics, which addresses similar concerns generated by the development and deployment of new digital technologies. Here, we tackle the important worry that digital ethics in general, and AI ethics in particular, lack adequate philosophical foundations. In direct response to that worry, we formulate and rationally justify some basic concepts and principles for digital ethics/AI ethics, all drawn from a broadly Kantian theory of human dignity. Our argument, which is designed to be relatively compact and easily accessible, is presented in ten distinct steps: (1) what “digital ethics” and “AI ethics” mean, (2) refuting the dignity-skeptic, (3) the metaphysics of human dignity, (4) human happiness or flourishing, true human needs, and human dignity, (5) our moral obligations with respect to all human real persons, (6) what a natural automaton or natural machine is, (7) why human real persons are not natural automata/natural machines: because consciousness is a form of life, (8) our moral obligations with respect to the design and use of artificial automata or artificial machines, aka computers, and digital technology more generally, (9) what privacy is, why invasions of digital privacy are morally impermissible, whereas consensual entrances into digital privacy are either morally permissible or even obligatory, and finally (10) dignitarian morality versus legality, and digital ethics/AI ethics. We conclude by asserting our strongly-held belief that a well-founded and generally-accepted dignitarian digital ethics/AI ethics is of global existential importance for humanity.",,,,,,,,,,,0.1847826086956521,,0.6363636363636364,0.2039193757596184,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While legal and technical problems are frequently discussed in academia, ethical issues of digital service chains and the commercialization of data are seldom investigated. Thus, based on outcomes of the Horizon2020 PANELFIT project, this work discusses current ethical issues related to cybersecurity. Utilizing expert workshops and encounters as well as a scientific literature review, ethical issues are mapped on individual steps of digital service chains. Not surprisingly, the results demonstrate that ethical challenges cannot be resolved in a general way, but need to be discussed individually and with respect to the ethical principles that are violated in the specific step of the service chain. Nevertheless, our results support practitioners by providing and discussing a list of ethical challenges to enable legally compliant as well as ethically acceptable solutions in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,0.1746987951807229,,0.0,0.164567133488386,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A nexus of data ethics issues is the concept of creep, or repurposing of data for other applications or research beyond the conditions of original collection. Data creep has proven controversial and has prompted concerns about the scope of ethical oversight. Institutional review boards offer little guidance regarding big data, and problematic research can still meet ethical standards. While ethics seem concrete through institutional deployment, I frame ethics as produced. Informed by my ethnographic research at a large public university in the U.S., I explore ethics through two models: ethics as institutional procedures and ethics as acts and intentions. The university where I conducted fieldwork is the development grounds for a predictive model that uses student data to anticipate academic success. While students consent to data collection, the circumstances of consent and the degree to which they are informed are not so apparent, as many data are a product of creep. Drawing from interviews and participant observation with administrators, data scientists, developers, and students, I examine data ethics, from a larger institutional model to everyday enactments related to data creep. After demonstrating the limits of such models, I propose a remodeling of ethics that draws on recent works on data, justice, and refusal to pose generative questions for rethinking ethics in institutional contexts.",,,,,,,,,,,0.1673640167364016,,0.3333333333333333,0.1734998520772579,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, sometimes discussions can become fragmented because of the different levels of governance (Schmitt in AI Ethics 1–12, 2021) or because of different values, stakeholders, and actors involved (Ryan and Stahl in J Inf Commun Ethics Soc 19:61–86, 2021). Recently, these conflicts became very visible, with such examples as the dismissal of AI ethics researcher Dr. Timnit Gebru from Google and the resignation of whistle-blower Frances Haugen from Facebook. Underpinning each debacle was a conflict between the organisation’s economic and business interests and the morals of their employees. This paper will examine tensions between the ethics of AI organisations and the values of their employees, by providing an exploration of the AI ethics literature in this area, and a qualitative analysis of three workshops with AI developers and practitioners. Common ethical and social tensions (such as power asymmetries, mistrust, societal risks, harms, and lack of transparency) will be discussed, along with proposals on how to avoid or reduce these conflicts in practice (e.g., building trust, fair allocation of responsibility, protecting employees’ autonomy, and encouraging ethical training and practice). Altogether, we suggest the following steps to help reduce ethical issues within AI organisations: improved and diverse ethics education and training within businesses; internal and external ethics auditing; the establishment of AI ethics ombudsmen, AI ethics review committees and an AI ethics watchdog; as well as access to trustworthy AI ethics whistle-blower organisations.",,,,,,,,,,,0.1857707509881423,,0.2,0.1865212711190153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought that displaying ethical behavior and providing digital security in digital environments can increase sensitivity to cyberbullying. Here, it is necessary to learn and apply the concepts of digital ethics and security correctly. For this reason, we can say that the places where we can learn and apply these concepts in the best way are educational environments. Therefore, the adoption of digital ethics and digital security concepts by pre-service teachers, both for themselves and for their future students, will raise awareness about the sensitivity to cyberbullying. This study also revealed that the concepts of digital ethics and security should be considered to increase the sensitivity of pre-service teachers to cyberbullying. In the research, the scanning model, one of the quantitative research designs, was used. Data were collected from 879 pre-service teachers studying at a state university. Within the scope of the research, three scales were used for pre-service teachers: “Cyberbullying Sensitivity Scale,“ “Digital Data Security Scale” and “The information and Communication Technologies Usage Ethics Scale.“ T-test, ANOVA, MANOVA, and regression tests were used in the analysis of the data. Because of the research, it was seen that the digital data security awareness, cyberbullying sensitivities, and digital ethics perceptions of pre-service teachers did not differ according to grade level, but differed according to gender and department level. Additionally, while digital data security awareness did not differ according to the department, it did not differ according to the combined effect of gender and department variables. Additionally, it was concluded that digital data security awareness predicts sensitivity to cyberbullying.

Project ECHO (Extension for Community Health Outcomes) is theoretically linked to improved sensemaking. This study examines the effectiveness of ECHO and training in use of sensemaking approaches to ethical response by clinicians. A quasi-experimental design study using univariate linear regression was used to examine the effect of the three types of ethics training on ethical response self-efficacy scores, while controlling for participant characteristics of years in practice, discipline and sex. We found evidence that training in sensemaking through participation in ECHO promotes improved ethical response self-efficacy of clinicians.

The framework we present draws upon our reviews of literature, course syllabi and existing frameworks on data ethics. For this research we reviewed 250 research methods syllabi from across the disciplines, as well as 80 syllabi from data science programmes to understand how or if data ethics was taught. We also reviewed 12 data ethics frameworks drawn from different sectors. Finally, we reviewed an extensive and diverse body of literature about data practices, research ethics, data ethics and critical data literacy, in order to develop a transversal model that can be adopted across higher education. To promote and support ethical approaches to the collection and use of data, ethics training must go beyond securing informed consent to enable a critical understanding of the techno-centric environment and the intersecting hierarchies of power embedded in technology and data. By fostering ethics as a method, educators can enable research that protects vulnerable groups and empower communities.",,,,,,,,,,,0.1731843575418994,,0.3076923076923077,0.1824753305507188,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the areas of human embryonic stem cells and clinical medicine, codes of Chinese medical ethics are gradually improving and becoming an essential part of the internationalization of medical ethics. This paper systematically describes the background, formulation process, and challenges in the development of two sets of ethical guidelines, the “Ethical Guidelines for Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research” and the “Ethical Review of Biomedical Research Involving Human Beings”. The development of medical ethics in China should guide not only the development of biotechnology but also strengthen the ethical governance of the scientific, medical, and bioethics communities and the government agencies that oversee their work.",,,,,,,,,,,0.1804511278195488,,0.1818181818181818,0.1805456868906005,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several AI ethics researchers have pointed out a lack of practical realization of these principles. Following that, AI ethics underwent a practical turn, but without deviating from the principled approach. This paper proposes a complementary to the principled approach that is based on virtue ethics. It defines four “basic AI virtues”, namely justice, honesty, responsibility and care, all of which represent specific motivational settings that constitute the very precondition for ethical decision making in the AI field. Moreover, it defines two “second-order AI virtues”, prudence and fortitude, that bolster achieving the basic virtues by helping with overcoming bounded ethicality or hidden psychological forces that can impair ethical decision making and that are hitherto disregarded in AI ethics. Lastly, the paper describes measures for successfully cultivating the mentioned virtues in organizations dealing with AI research and development.",,,,,,,,,,,0.1677419354838709,,0.3,0.1754407107424119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
