Several frameworks and legal regulations have been adopted to clarify and define the various ethical challenges in digital contexts. These initiatives often accentuate one of three components: data security, data governance, or digital strategy. However, an integrated approach is required to meet the current demand for an ethical and sustainable approach to digitalization and address the growing number of challenges occurring in handling data and related peripheral components. This paper develops the concept of an integrated framework to incorporate all relevant aspects of digital ethics by combining three categories of digital contexts: law and regulations, ethics and justice, and environmental sustainability. The core of this integrated framework, the Fribourg sustainable digital ethics framework (FSDEF), consists of two boundary conditions of sustainable development: social thresholds of justice and ecological planetary boundaries. It also incorporates numerous other frameworks and standards, including value-based engineering and IEEE standards.",Digital ethics;sustainability;corporate digital responsibility,"UniFR_ESH Institute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; UniFR_ESH Institute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland; Human-IST Insitute, University of Fribourg, Fribourg, Switzerland",13 Sep 2021,,,156.0,162.0,2573-1998,978-1-6654-2512-4,,Ethics;Law;Data security;Green products;Companies;IEEE Standards;Regulation,data governance;environmental factors;ethical aspects;IEEE standards;law;public administration;security of data;sustainable development,sustainable digitalization;digitization initiatives;legal regulations;data security;data governance;digital strategy;peripheral components;justice;environmental sustainability;Fribourg sustainable digital ethics framework;sustainable development;ethical digitalization;data handling;law;regulations;ethics;FSDEF;value-based engineering;IEEE standards;public institutions;private companies,,2.0,20.0,IEEE,13 Sep 2021,IEEE,0.1925465838509316,1.25,0.375,0.2505032957755626

The development of AI requires us to invent new knowledge, new know‐how and new ways of living with these new technologies. The chapter focuses on the five stages of ethics, namely ethics of data, ethics of systems, ethics of algorithms, ethics of practice and ethics of decisions.

While AI technologies can provide benefits to humans and society, the unexpected consequences (e.g., malfunctions) of AI systems can cause social losses. For this reason, research on ethical design for the development of AI-based systems is becoming important. In this paper, from existing studies on AI ethics, general guidelines such as transparency, explainability, predictability, accountability, fairness, privacy, and control for the ethical design of AI systems are reviewed. And, based on the ethical design guidelines, we discuss ethical design to reduce the negative effects of biased data and unethical dialogues in AI-based conversational chatbots.",conversational chatbot;ethical design;framework,"Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejun, Republic of Korea; Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Republic of Korea; University of Science and Technology, Daejun, Republic of Korea; University of Science and Technology, Daejun, Republic of Korea",20 Jan 2022,,,1.0,5.0,,978-1-6654-1766-2,Korean National Police Agency; ,Ethics;Privacy;Systematics;Chatbots;Social factors;Stakeholders;Artificial intelligence,artificial intelligence;data privacy;ethical aspects;expert systems;law administration;natural language processing;software agents;virtual reality,ethical chatbot design;biased data;unethical conversations;AI technology;public service domains;private service domains;existing computing systems;AI systems;AI-based systems;AI ethics;privacy;ethical design guidelines;AI-based conversational chatbots,,7.0,33.0,IEEE,20 Jan 2022,IEEE,0.1842105263157894,0.0,0.3076923076923077,0.1874553779461243

The goal of this research is to see how the phenomena of big data might make ethical decisions more difficult for organizations.

AI is being applied in more and more fields and scenarios such as autonomous driving, medical care, media, finance, industrial robots, and internet services. The widespread application of AI and its deep integration with the economy and society have improved efficiency and produced benefits. At the same time, it will inevitably impact the existing social order and raise ethical concerns. Ethical issues, such as privacy leakage, discrimination, unemployment, and security risks, brought about by AI systems have caused great trouble to people. Therefore, AI ethics, which is a field related to the study of ethical issues in AI, has become not only an important research topic in academia, but also an important topic of common concern for individuals, organizations, countries, and society. This article will give a comprehensive overview of this field by summarizing and analyzing the ethical risks and issues raised by AI, ethical guidelines and principles issued by different organizations, approaches for addressing ethical issues in AI, and methods for evaluating the ethics of AI.

This article explores how service users (e.g., patients and users of mental health services) and peer support specialists understand and perceive issues of privacy, confidentiality, and security of digital mental health interventions. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted among service users (n = 17) and peer support specialists (n = 15) from a convenience sample at an urban community mental health center in the United States. We identified technology ownership and use, lack of technology literacy including limited understanding of privacy, confidentiality, and security as the main barriers to engagement among service users. Peers demonstrated a high level of technology engagement, literacy of digital mental health tools, and a more comprehensive awareness of digital mental health ethics. We recommend peer support specialists as a potential resource to facilitate the ethical engagement of digital mental health interventions for service users. Finally, engaging potential end-users in the development cycle of digital mental health support platforms and increased privacy regulations may lead the field to a better understanding of effective uses of technology for people with mental health conditions.

We recognize that these AI digital tools are a vital aspect of future technological development, but they require input from various sectors in addressing ethics and compliance design. We survey the current landscape of published AI-specific regulatory frameworks and known engineering design process methods. Using a product lifecycle approach, we also introduce a trans-disciplinary framework to address AI ethics and compliance via design. This product lifecycle approach considers several principles: a Human-Centered Design for Risk Assessment, Functional Safety and Risk Management Standardization, and Continuous Governance throughout Product Lifecycle. Establishing risk management throughout AI product lifecycles can ensure accountability for AI product use cases. In addition, by utilizing previous Functional Safety considerations we can create safety mechanisms throughout the product lifecycle of AI digital tools. Finally, establishing in-field testing for continuous governance will enable the flexibility for new compliance standards and transparency.
