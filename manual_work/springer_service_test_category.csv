Ethical mindedness, guided by defensible, high standards, is a disposition and a practice that encompasses respect and impartiality regarding individuals, teams, organizations and phenomena. Ethical imagination is the capability to examine and identify potential ethical issues in novel situations and create ethical ways to confront them. To ensure that ethical practices occur in higher education research, institutional ethics committees are required to examine the ethical implication of each research application based on publicly espoused regulatory ethical guidelines and standards. However, ethics committees can only call for compliance with regulations and standards but cannot ensure that all researchers will exercise ethical behaviour when they are confronted with unforeseen ethically ambiguous conditions. For this reason, in this chapter, we assert that assuring ethical research practices requires more than ensuring compliance with a set of rules. Ethics should be viewed as a knowledge discipline, incorporating attributes of ethical mindedness and ethical imagination that are fostered as graduate dispositions and capabilities that contribute to the development of ethically-minded business professionals. To conclude the chapter, we will generate a conceptual framework for situating the role of ethical mindedness and ethical imagination in a supportive institutional climate and culture in postgraduate professions-oriented research education. We also offer two propositions that would provide the opportunity for empirical testing and theoretical advancement in the field of ethics education.",,0.2145748987854251,0.5454545454545454,0.2322332426232071

However, sometimes discussions can become fragmented because of the different levels of governance (Schmitt in AI Ethics 1–12, 2021) or because of different values, stakeholders, and actors involved (Ryan and Stahl in J Inf Commun Ethics Soc 19:61–86, 2021). Recently, these conflicts became very visible, with such examples as the dismissal of AI ethics researcher Dr. Timnit Gebru from Google and the resignation of whistle-blower Frances Haugen from Facebook. Underpinning each debacle was a conflict between the organisation’s economic and business interests and the morals of their employees. This paper will examine tensions between the ethics of AI organisations and the values of their employees, by providing an exploration of the AI ethics literature in this area, and a qualitative analysis of three workshops with AI developers and practitioners. Common ethical and social tensions (such as power asymmetries, mistrust, societal risks, harms, and lack of transparency) will be discussed, along with proposals on how to avoid or reduce these conflicts in practice (e.g., building trust, fair allocation of responsibility, protecting employees’ autonomy, and encouraging ethical training and practice). Altogether, we suggest the following steps to help reduce ethical issues within AI organisations: improved and diverse ethics education and training within businesses; internal and external ethics auditing; the establishment of AI ethics ombudsmen, AI ethics review committees and an AI ethics watchdog; as well as access to trustworthy AI ethics whistle-blower organisations.",,0.1857707509881423,0.2,0.1865212711190153

It is thought that displaying ethical behavior and providing digital security in digital environments can increase sensitivity to cyberbullying. Here, it is necessary to learn and apply the concepts of digital ethics and security correctly. For this reason, we can say that the places where we can learn and apply these concepts in the best way are educational environments. Therefore, the adoption of digital ethics and digital security concepts by pre-service teachers, both for themselves and for their future students, will raise awareness about the sensitivity to cyberbullying. This study also revealed that the concepts of digital ethics and security should be considered to increase the sensitivity of pre-service teachers to cyberbullying. In the research, the scanning model, one of the quantitative research designs, was used. Data were collected from 879 pre-service teachers studying at a state university. Within the scope of the research, three scales were used for pre-service teachers: “Cyberbullying Sensitivity Scale,“ “Digital Data Security Scale” and “The information and Communication Technologies Usage Ethics Scale.“ T-test, ANOVA, MANOVA, and regression tests were used in the analysis of the data. Because of the research, it was seen that the digital data security awareness, cyberbullying sensitivities, and digital ethics perceptions of pre-service teachers did not differ according to grade level, but differed according to gender and department level. Additionally, while digital data security awareness did not differ according to the department, it did not differ according to the combined effect of gender and department variables.

The session covered dominant ethical theories and principles, the defining moments in medical research ethics and the ethical aspects of laboratory practices. At the end of the session a short optional paper survey was distributed to the participants to obtain feedback on the training. The feedback was anonymous and thematically coded. Attendees reported to be more aware of the existence and importance of ‘everyday’ ethics in their workplace. Responses also showed that the training session had provided participants with an opportunity for ethical reflection in themselves and in discussion with their colleagues. Despite clinical laboratory professionals being faced with ethical challenges daily, there is comparatively little ethics education provided. Ethics training is believed to improve the ethical attitude of laboratory staff and help them when making decisions in their work.

A nexus of data ethics issues is the concept of creep, or repurposing of data for other applications or research beyond the conditions of original collection. Data creep has proven controversial and has prompted concerns about the scope of ethical oversight. Institutional review boards offer little guidance regarding big data, and problematic research can still meet ethical standards. While ethics seem concrete through institutional deployment, I frame ethics as produced. Informed by my ethnographic research at a large public university in the U.S., I explore ethics through two models: ethics as institutional procedures and ethics as acts and intentions. The university where I conducted fieldwork is the development grounds for a predictive model that uses student data to anticipate academic success. While students consent to data collection, the circumstances of consent and the degree to which they are informed are not so apparent, as many data are a product of creep. Drawing from interviews and participant observation with administrators, data scientists, developers, and students, I examine data ethics, from a larger institutional model to everyday enactments related to data creep.

Within the field of health AI ethics, the solutions to the questions posed by ethical issues such as informed consent, bias, safety, transparency, patient privacy, and allocation are complex and difficult to navigate. The increasing amount of data, market forces, and changing landscape of health care suggest that medical students may be faced with a workplace in which understanding how to safely and effectively interact with health AIs will be essential. Here we argue that there is a need to teach health AI ethics in medical schools. Real events in health AI already pose ethical challenges to the medical community. We discuss key ethical issues requiring medical school education and suggest that case studies based on recent real-life examples are useful tools to teach the ethical issues raised by health AIs.",,0.1655629139072847,0.3,0.1731650110375276

This study aimed at discovering the degree to which Omani undergraduate students practiced digital citizenship during the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were 262 undergraduate students (116 males and 164 females) who took an online university elective course at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU) in Spring of 2021. The study adopted a quantitative approach to data collection to investigate students’ digital citizenship practices. An online situational judgment test was developed and conducted to address six dimensions of digital citizenship: digital identity, digital civic engagement, digital ethics, digital literacy, digital safety, and global digital communication. The findings show that the level of practicing digital citizenship dimensions ranged from intermediate to low. Additionally, the results show that the least practiced dimensions are digital civic engagement and digital identity. Further, the results indicated some gender differences in students’ practices of digital citizenship. Considering the results, more efforts are required from stakeholders to enhance the level of DC among undergraduates. The findings of the study are considered good indicators to be taken when designing and evaluating curricula at higher education institutions.",,0.1623036649214659,0.1333333333333333,0.1601685965353223
