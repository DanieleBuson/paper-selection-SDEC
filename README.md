# paper-selection-SDEC (Swiss Digital Ethics Compass)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **paper-selection-SDEC**, a project developed in collaboration with Swiss Post and Innosuisse. This initiative aims to create a Swiss Digital Ethics Compass (SDEC) by leveraging Python for web scraping and data analysis to facilitate the selection of scientific papers.

## Project Overview
The **paper-selection-SDEC** project was initiated to address the need for a comprehensive approach to navigating digital ethics literature. Thanks to the support from Swiss Post and Innosuisse, we've been able to develop a solution that not only aids in the research process but also contributes to the academic community through the upcoming publication of a scientific paper.

## Features
- **Web Scraping**: The project utilizes Python for efficient web scraping, extracting abstracts from relevant sources.
- **Scoring System**: Our code implements a scoring mechanism to evaluate the eligibility and inclusion of papers in the Digital Ethics Compass.
- **Publication**: Keep an eye out for our upcoming scientific paper, where we share insights, methodologies, and outcomes from the **paper-selection-SDEC** project.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the provided documentation to set up the environment.
3. Run the Python scripts to perform web scraping and generate scores for paper selection.

Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute to the advancement of digital ethics research!

## Acknowledgments
We express our gratitude to Swiss Post and Innosuisse for their financial support, making this project possible. We look forward to sharing our findings with the global research community through the upcoming publication.

Your contributions and feedback are highly welcomed.

Happy coding!
